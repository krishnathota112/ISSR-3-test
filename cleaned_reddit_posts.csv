1gd9l9c,1730031213.0,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

1e297nd,1720873558.0,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",21,27,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,hey rmentalhealth looking grow moderation team moderators key part makes reddit community special interested helping make community special wed like talk mods moderators mentalhealth work build community make safe place discuss many facets mental health ways mental health mental wellness influence daily life moderators help write rules respond content concerns set policies update community themes appearance manage automation general upkeep minimum requirements apply apply ive never moderator care mental health would like part amazing team moderators wed like hear prior experience plus important thing looking want moderators care mental health rmentalhealth community fit well team want help describes steps wed like take apply steps include open ended questions wed like thoughtful answers everything else might need know help learn along way youre interested moderating want get head start know recommend check reddit training offered expectations moderators join rmentalhealth mod team mod team members need part team need people engage communicate see questions mod team supportive understanding know life outside reddit expect put life first sometimes means might less time moderate thats okay expect communication coordination support bring help need anything know moderating rmentalhealth apply yes rmentalhealth support community mental health often encounter posts comments describe traumatic experiences crisis content disturbing team policy post comment much one us handle let rest team know someone else step handle way eliminate exposure completely apply please expect ask comfort level moderating content nature strategies might use make sure mental health needs met one expected address issues uncomfortable expect encounter things join team second require moderators join discord server communicate coordinate moderation efforts part application process includes joining us server chat need discord account existing account one apply interested joining team process follow send us modmail indicating interested include answers following questions mental health mean interested moderator rmentalhealth opinion differences good moderator bad moderator review modmail application may ask additional information moderation experience familiar reddit may use google form structure questions invite candidates think might good fit join us discord server interact get know making decision extending invitation moderator new moderators rmentalhealth moderator team start trial run last four weeks time trial moderator limited moderation responsibilities evaluation help provide structured way get speed thanks reading hope apply

I've also been feeling really anxious, which has caused me to avoid my responsibilities. I tend to run away from things (going to school). I know I should face these things, but I just can't seem to find the motivation/ energy to do so. One time, I was walking around the mall, and suddenly I became really confused. I had no idea why I was even there, and I felt completely disconnected from my surroundings.

I really want this to stop, but I don't know how to break free from this feeling. Has anyone here also experienced this?

1jbu7m7,1742042359.0,I Miss My Old Life. Wanted to Cry.,"I was just looking at some old pictures. Pictures from my late teens, like when I was 17. And I really miss my old life.

Back then my life was hardly ideal, to be clear. I was still struggling with depression and anxiety, though to a much lesser degree than now. As well as body dysmorphia. But beyond that my actual life was leagues and bounds better.

I had friends. I was young. I had just graduated high school and was going to a great college. I had a girlfriend I loved. My parents were financially secure. I was healthy and on top of that in good shape. I was never a social butterfly or anything, but I was at times going out or doing other fun things. I was working pretty actively on my writing with the hope of eventually publishing a novel. I lived in a stable, safe, democratic and prosperous country.

Now everything is different.

I have no friends. I'm maybe not quite ""old"" but I am much older. I had to quit college and have been unemployed for a long time now, with no real prospects of changing that. I don't have a girlfriend anymore, I've been single for over a year, and I feel desperately unable to find one. My parents' financial security is not what it once was either. I'm still healthy for now, thank God, but I am no longer in great shape. I'm not obese or anything, but I'm not in good shape anymore either. I haven't gone out and done something fun in about a year and a half. My mental health issues feel like they make it impossible to write. And it feels like the world these days is so much more unstable than it used to be.

I was struggling back when I was 17 with issues. But at the same time, I did have some feeling that there was hope as well. That maybe I could struggle through everything.

Nowadays though... I don't feel that anymore. Not only do I feel depressed, but completely hopeless. Like my chance to live a good life is gone.

I want to cry, but I won't. Because I suck at that too.",2,1,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jbu7m7/i_miss_my_old_life_wanted_to_cry/,looking old pictures pictures late teens like really miss old life back life hardly ideal clear still struggling depression anxiety though much lesser degree well body dysmorphia beyond actual life leagues bounds better friends young graduated high school going great college girlfriend loved parents financially secure healthy top good shape never social butterfly anything times going fun things working pretty actively writing hope eventually publishing novel lived stable safe democratic prosperous country everything different friends im maybe quite old much older quit college unemployed long time real prospects changing dont girlfriend anymore ive single year feel desperately unable find one parents financial security either im still healthy thank god longer great shape im obese anything im good shape anymore either havent gone done something fun year half mental health issues feel like make impossible write feels like world days much unstable used struggling back issues time feeling hope well maybe could struggle everything nowadays though dont feel anymore feel depressed completely hopeless like chance live good life gone want cry wont suck
1jbtlwo,1742040216.0,Might be the worst day of my life,"I really don't know how things could get any worse. My family is ready to disown me at any moment due to religion, which would make me homeless and lose my only source of income, I had to leave the girl I like behind in another continent, my friends rarely speak to me anymore and to top it all off one of my closest friends (only know online) who I've known for over a year, who knows and has helped me through every significant struggle in my life, who used to be so excited to meet me one day, has just told me they never want to see me in person out of caution, and now it's possible our friendship may just be over.

1jbuv1d,1742044512.0,At an impasse in life,"I have just heard a stranger sharing their career success and it triggered me. Now I have suicidal and self-harm urges, such ad throwing myself down the stairs. I think deep down I want to punish myself for not being successful like other people whom I compare myself to. (I used to be at the top of my games when I was younger).

I'm 35F,  in a bad time in my life. I'm still recovering from a one-year crisis (psychosis because I stopped medication on my own, intense anxiety, intense suicidal ideation and urges, repeated hospitalization).
- having an MA degree but unemployed,
- having a poor employment prospect due to my employment history and the labor market situation,
- having just a few hundreds of euros in savings,
- living on sickness and soon rehabilitation allowances, and
- having long-standing habits that harm my finances but which are extremely hard to change.

Bipolar disorder makes it hard to bounce back.
- I sleep 12 hours a day due to medication side effects,
- I can't function under pressure,
- I can't pursue two things at the same time, which means I can't do side hustles or study and work at the same time,
- I have trouble keeping a consistent schedule due to oversleeping and changing moods (though mostly stabilized). I spend a lot of time during the day on activities that help balance my mood, taking time away from job search and learning the local language etc. (I'm an immigrant).

I'm undiagnosed with anything cause I've never attended real therapy, but I seem to be really social anxious since I was like little kid. Nobody ever tried to help me because people tend to like shy and conventionally attractive in any sense people more. I'm absolutely fucked up to the point any human communication lead me to panic, shaking, sweating and picking my skin extremely. 

I thought online communication was the best option for me cause I can find genuine people from all over the world that have similar interests and problems, but nope. I'm just too afraid. No one can hurt me through the screen, but it's just so overwhelming. I've made a bunch of nice bonds with interesting people, but only with the ones who can understand my problem. People think I'm a terrible person cause I ignore them for a really long time and I even received threats once.

1jbuqhq,1742044103.0,My roommate might be going through a psychotic episode. I need help.,"I am a college student living in a co-living rental apartment. Essentially I get to rent a room in a giant unit with 6 other rooms. Each person gets to have a private room and private bathroom, but we share the living room and kitchen.

I came back home after a friend's birthday party at around 2am, and then went to my bedroom. I came back outside to the fridge to grab some food. That's when my other roommate came out of his room and talked to me. This said roommate is already graduated and maybe employed. I've never had a problem with him and he's always been nice to me. But I notice that he's a bit of a clean freak, scrubbing and cleaning every corner of the kitchen isle and the laundry for hours.

Tonight he suddenly walked out of his room and told me that he knows that I've been using a tracking device to secretly record him, and that I've been stalking him. I was completely confused and asked how, and he said I'm using a device called ""homebot"" and he said that there's proof. He showed me his phone and showed a weird app or website where there's different colored squares that says ""pay xxx"" or ""pay yyy"" and x and y bring names of random people I don't know about. He said that he found that he's being tracked and when he opened the door, he saw me heading to my bedroom, so I was probably sitting on the couch outside of his room secretly tracking him, and then immediately running away after he notices me. I was also bringing a camera beside me because I do film and videography. He asked to check my camera and asked me to turn it to another direction in case it's secretly filming him. He said he knows what I've done and I should be thankful because he won't tell anyone and get me into trouble. I asked him what would I track him for and he said he's been using VPN to surf the net and that the police might have talked to me secretly and told me to help them track him. He said he's in his room all day but everyone ""seems to have a problem"" with him and that for the last few hours his life is threatened due to the tracking device. He said if it isn't me, then it has to be someone else in this apartment building.

He hasn't shaved for days and his eyes look crazed. I think he might be showing symptoms of paranoia and/or delusion disorder, and having a psychotic episode. What can I do to persuade him that I'm not some secret stalker employed by the police?

I cant keep feeling like this. 😭 is it just pent up anxiety im ignoring?

Ways to naturally calm down nightmares?? 

Supplements? Meditation exercises? 

I went from unwilling insomnia (1-3 hours of sleep a night max) to being able to sleep but dreading sleep or having nightmares. 

Lastly, my internal critic really goes into overdrive after these nightmares. ""Maybe my kids ARE better off somwhere else."" ""What if i ruin everything I have built"" to even just ""why isnt my brain just normal man?""

1jbtdu5,1742039384.0,Morning and night anxiety and depression,"Why is my depression and anxiety the absolute worst in the morning and night time?

Of course, there are good days and bad days, however even on the best of days either one or both are still present, however I'm able to get out of bed / lay down and fall asleep without too much trouble.  On the worst days it's fetal position, uncontrollable emotions and thoughts which are mostly negative, inability to get out of bed / insomnia which of course tends to make me spital further leading to inevitable suicidal thoughts (Which I do not want to have)

80% of the day (assuming I slept) Is usually okay, staying busy, activities and distractions get me through the day until it's time for bed.  I could have had the best day ever but as soon as it's time for bed it's become a dice roll and if I roll a 1....negative thoughts, stresses, regrets, you name it it's comming in hard and I'm probably not going to fall asleep which is almost definitely going to affect me the next day.

My life isn't perfect, nor am I.  I have made mistakes and have regrets and fears like everyone else.

Is this normal?  Do alot of people have this problem?

1jbt6mi,1742038592.0,What's your opinion on these thoughts?,"I have noticed in many situations that my mind goes to thoughts that I find upsetting/distressing. For example, I have just gone to a massage parlour in Asia while travelling and while the very sweet lady is talking to me I think ""how horrible would it be if I punched you in the face?"" and go through the whole process in my mind of how she would react, how awful it would be to do that to someone so sweet and how guilty I would feel. It goes without saying that I never would do that, but I process it to the extent that I begin feeling the emotions such as guilt and sadness over something I didn't even do. There are many other situations like this where I do this and think ""I could do x if I wanted to"" when talking to someone. Technically yes, I could, but I wouldn't so I don't get why my mind goes there. 

What would you describe this as? Definite it as?

1jbq1r1,1742024748.0,Can you be addicted to sleep deprivation?,"It’s been a bad habit of mine for a long time my time. Back when I was in school, I would pull all-nighters before important days like oral presentations, because it gave me a loopy and euphoric feeling that lasted long enough until the big day. When time came to speak, I would feel less socially anxious and had less panic attacks. Normally, my face gets all red, voice shaky like I’m about to cry, but when sleep deprived, it was all gone, so I just I used it like a crutch.

Now I’m older and don’t go to school anymore. Did go to college, but dropped out many times. Currently unemployed . I’ve found myself using sleep deprivation again. It makes me feel I guess happier? But mostly numb. Also, I can tell I won’t be sleeping when I sense the coming day being a bad one. When I start feeling anxious about the future and completely hopeless, I just refuse to go to sleep. I stay up all night, listen to music, browse internet, distracting myself just refusing to wake up to tomorrow by staying up. I won’t lie, my body does feel like death at times, but since my mind is in a incredibly better place in a euphoric way, I don’t mind it at all because my numbed brain compensates for the physical pain. 

Anyway, I’m addicted to it and it feels weird to even say. I’ve told the only people I know, my parents and they don’t understand. I feel guilty, because some people can’t even get sleep from work/life, and I’m here staying up because it’s makes me numb which sounds like nonsense.

1jbpmsv,1742022885.0,feeling pretty hopeless after recent doctors appointment,"i, 20f, have been struggling with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and OCD since i was about 13. i started sertraline when i was 14 and am currently on 50mg

ever since i was 16, i have developed some kind of sleep disorder, a mix between insomnia and hypersomnia. i can sleep for 30 hours +, and then have times where i can’t sleep for three nights straight.

my doctor knows about this and has prescribed me amitriptyline to help me get to sleep, which works great, but when i’m in a really bad fatigue stage, genuinely nothing can help. i cant get a job because of this, meaning i have no source of income. my parents are officially my caregivers and are given a small payment fro the government to look after me, but that’s it.

at my recent appointment, i went over these issues with her again. she said that medication is only half of the treatment, which is why i’m not getting better, and i really need psychotherapy, mainly CBT. she says that my sleep issues are very likely connected to my mental health issues

i completely see where she’s coming from and i don’t doubt her. this appointment has just left me so hopeless now. i cannot afford therapy. like at all. i was able to get free therapy when i was 16 and under but no cannot because i’m no longer a minor. like i said earlier, i cannot get a job because of these issues, and my parents are only being paid a very small amount, it only covers my medication and some food.

therapy appointments here start at $100 an hour and there’s no way i can afford that, it took us a month just to be able to afford a regular GP appointment. i’m at a dead end, i fear there’s nothing more i can do and that scares me. i’ve been doing these stupid online surveys and stuff to try and earn some cash but it’s only pocket change.

i feel stupid because i know there’s people out there that have it so much worse than me, it just sucks. my parents feel so guilty they can’t help more, and i always tell them it’s not their fault. i’m so sorry for everyone else in a similar position too.

1jbp9to,1742021288.0,Is it over for me? I have tried everything it seems like but the doors keep closing on me. A lack of friends for life?,"I don’t think I can run from this issue no more, I am legit two decades old now. I should have this shit figured out about by now. Why don’t have a lot of friends? Why does my social life seem so sad? 

I was in my first year of high school when the pandemic came. In junior high I had a good group of friend and felt good in myself. In high school our friend group got separated so half went one place and other somewhere else. I lost touch with the other members of the group after about 2 years. In high school I hung out with my friends from junior high (they are my best friends in my opinion now). But the pandemic hindered my ability to make more friends, ruined my progress. 

To be honest, I feel the pandemic fucked a lot up for me. I felt more anxious, family fighting, depression cause my grades were slipping and I was scared about getting into university, couldn’t find a part time job. Luckily, I got through that stuff without end it all. I live in a city where everyone attends uni where they did high school. So they live with friends or stay at home with family. I got into university thankfully and I’m grateful to be living with my family at home. It makes me shitty for complaining, but on the other side I feel I like feeling lonely is worse than economic troubles at times. My family isn’t rich by any means, barely middle class (maybe lower middle class now a days). Being low income isn’t as bad when you have a collective community to turn to. 

I feel like my two friends closest friends are now drifting away. I have tried to make new friends in uni and my major but they never last or go beyond surface area. I feel no one is really that interested in me. I have tried everything, even tried going to therapy (I did learn some things), but still no damn change. I have some class friends in my major and they are great people, honestly I would love to be friends outside of class. But they are a bit older than me and graduating this year. I look at myself as I will be graduating next year, why has these last three years been sorta bad in achieving my goal of making friends? 

I can’t go to events or have fun during the breaks or holidays as I don’t have a lot of friends. Now that I’m graduating next year, I feel if I start working or doing more education I feel like the loneliness is gonna feel even stronger. I have strict parents and eldest daughter of middle eastern immigrants so that does play a part in who I am friends with. I don’t wanna be friends with someone who more about going out constantly and drinking, partying, etc. I am not a prude. 

Also tho I am not that religious or cultured to be friends with people like that. I fit in no where it feel like at times.

1jbrhsy,1742031395.0,Starting to think I have a paranoia issue,"just to preface I'm not asking for medical advise or a diagnosis, just others opinions who might've gone through similar thing.

I'm  22 year old male andI'm diagnosed bi-polar (if that'll help at all) and especially as of recent I've been feeling more and more paranoid, this has kinda always been a think since I was young, overactive imagination I'd call it, always scared people were looking through windows or I was being followed, constantly looking behind me while walking home. When I was a child it was always some monster but it got more real as I got older and into high-school I couldn't go a few seconds without looking over my shoulder swearing I could feel eyes on me, feeling like people are out to harm me in some way - we're gonna fast forward awhile past a long drug addiction and some other stuff and now I'm 22 and I've been clean for over a year, the paranoia I remember so well has slowly been coming back but in such a worse form than it previously was, its no longer thinking that someone is out to hurt me but believing that I'm in dangers path, that there is most definitely somebody on the other side of my door that wants to hurt me. I refuse to go outside when its dark cause if I do I'm just scanning left and right and listening for even the smallest of noises to prove to myself that someone is there stalking me, if I see a car outside that I don't recognize I go outside to look at its license plate to remember it, when I hear noises outside my house I peer out a window to watch whoever it is to make sure they're not there for me, I get angry sometimes when I feel extra paranoid and I cant escape the situation, I'll take different routes home to avoid running into someone who thinks they know my route. 

This doesn't feel normal what so ever, Its genuinely starting to affect my life and how I live it and I can't get rid of the thoughts in my head that make me believe I'm being stalked, I probably sound crazed and there's little to no evidence to say I am, it just feels like I'm being watched wherever I go, can anyone give tips on how they've dealt with this if they have thank you.",1,0,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jbrhsy/starting_to_think_i_have_a_paranoia_issue/,preface im asking medical advise diagnosis others opinions mightve gone similar thing im year old male andim diagnosed bipolar thatll help especially recent ive feeling paranoid kinda always think since young overactive imagination id call always scared people looking windows followed constantly looking behind walking home child always monster got real got older highschool couldnt go seconds without looking shoulder swearing could feel eyes feeling like people harm way gon na fast forward awhile past long drug addiction stuff im ive clean year paranoia remember well slowly coming back worse form previously longer thinking someone hurt believing im dangers path definitely somebody side door wants hurt refuse go outside dark cause im scanning left right listening even smallest noises prove someone stalking see car outside dont recognize go outside look license plate remember hear noises outside house peer window watch whoever make sure theyre get angry sometimes feel extra paranoid cant escape situation ill take different routes home avoid running someone thinks know route doesnt feel normal ever genuinely starting affect life live cant get rid thoughts head make believe im stalked probably sound crazed theres little evidence say feels like im watched wherever go anyone give tips theyve dealt thank
1jbreh1,1742030969.0,Messy post about recent life struggles,"I have been struggling with my mental health for years, and I have «good» and bad periods. Lately it’s been bad; unresolved trauma that came to the surface, increased work stress, fear of losing my job, being sick and in a lot of pain. I feel like I’ve completely lost who I was. 
6 months ago I met a guy who has been so damn supportive it’s almost ridiculous. Yesterday he broke it off. I can’t say I blame him, I’ve been horrible for weeks. I’ve been apologizing and trying to explain, but I’ve noticed the same things happening over and over again. In a way it has only made me feel worse. I’ve lost contact with my friends and after he broke it off it feels like the ground (or my whole support system) has been ripped from under my feet. I don’t know how I will get through this, but I will - eventually. I have to meet him later today to exchange our things, man that’s going to be hard. 
Ah, I feel like I fumbled the best guy I’ve ever known. Maybe it won’t feel like that in a few weeks or months but now it does. He was so much more than I ever deserved, and I hope he finds someone who can treat him the way he deserves. 
I’ve been planning on going to therapy for a year now, but have been putting it off because I’ve been scared. Time to do this now, for me :)

1jbqvg6,1742028520.0,how to fix myself,"Hi, ill get straight to the point. i'm a very self reflective person and feel like i know what im doing wrong, but i also know that i dont.

Im currently in college, ive had good friends throughout. But, i receive a lot of hate; both subtle and not. Throughout high school, i was very oblivious and immature. I was incredibly rude to everyone, by being curious and pointing out and stating things that were obviously very emotionally potent to them. for ex. I was talking to a girl who evidently had a lot of acne and was vocally sad about it, and during a conversation about a travel through a bumpy road and out of nowhere, absolutely unprovoked, i say ""like your face"".

it got even worse, where a girl who was overweight was talking to me about her cutting herself and i said""do you cut yourself cause youre fat""(mind you i used to cut myself too.) Absolutely no clue as to why I said it. I've come to realise that im a very reactionary-heavy person, I really like seeing the reaction on peoples faces. I really , really have this validation issue of wanting to be liked by everyone, But im actively trying to get over it. I also have this issue where i try to rebuttal every sentence someone is saying or i just say shit for interaction or validation.

Because of this, in highschool i only had a handful of people who liked me, and now i do have people who like me but only on a face level, i dont really have close, close friends and i think thats because theyre just trying to be nice. I really want to be a nice person, how do i fix myself. in addition, i also want to add that i have extreme parental trauma, wherein ever since i was a 5-6 year old, my dad would emotionally abuse and physically hit me . for example, i would always get low grades but was considered a bright child, and everytime i did i would get hit with a belt, a wire, a clothes hanger or slapped.

i have been locked in a 4ft by 5 ft room at 13 for 20 hours without eating and pissed in a container as it was the pantry. i have been physically dragged out my parents house by my neck when i was 12-13 for talking back to them and was just walking around the streets for eight hours with nowhere to go to, as like i said before, i didnt have any friends. i've also been bullied all my life in elementry school and below until i found soccer and got good at it, then people started respecting me because i was touted to go pro, and now i due to an unfortunate series of circumstances, i might not. and it really got me depressed, as it was all i hvd ever known.

i also really seeked validation from my dad. i was also depressed at cutting myself at 14 for like 7 months during covid but got over it. look i dont mean to trauma dump but i think this might be necessary. i have also never have a girlfriend and really crave for one , and i dont know why. like i always think my life would be better with a girlfriend.

im at a point where i really really need opinion, and i havent told anyone close to me who know me these things as i really really hate pity.

1jbqtxr,1742028337.0,I just wish for someone to hear my little story even if its not much (kinda long so if you don't wanna read it then don't),"  
So back in the 7th grade, I was diagnosed with a not really talked about condition called UC, short for ulcerative colitis. I was thriving; I was dating someone, I was super social, and my mental health was great, but soon.... I got some stomach cramps at first...my mom thought there were ulcers, so she took me to the doctor, and they did nothing, gave me medicine that didn't work. I lay around for 1, maybe 2 weeks, not eating, just drinking water and continually having bowel movements and throwing up even though I had nothing in my system... My mom then finally took me to the hospital after the weeks of suffering and doctors saying nothing... The hospital got me on an IV, gave me steroids, and said I'd be fine, and I believed them. I thought I could go back to school, and I'd be fine... But little did I know, 1 week later, I got sick again. My mom did the same thing, waiting it out like a week or 2, and this time it was worse. I lost so much weight and was in worse pain that I couldn't sleep or move. I was either in bed or the restroom every 10 minutes... I did nothing but sit there and sulk, and then one day I was getting ready to go to my infusion, but I passed out fully in the shower, so my mom drove me to the hospital, and I was in severe pain, like being stabbed in the stomach. I had 4 doctors, and none of them did shit for me. I had a tube put down my nose and had been fed through there, but soon I could get up and walk and rest and stuff, but I got out and had to do homeschooling, but after like 4 months of that, I went back to school after Christmas break, but things were different; people were different. I felt so alone and lonely, and that's when I got bad mental health thoughts. I was lonely, barely had any good friends, was more angry and sad all the time, and my partner broke up with me, and it didn't help that after they started being physically abusive to me.... And now today as a 14 almost 15-year-old, I still feel the exact same way; I've gotten therapy and gotten kind of better, but I still have bad thoughts about myself and tend to think bad things.

This caused my therapist to call 988 and have me hospitalized. Eventually they took me to a “stress center” where they made me get naked and the nurse did a bunch of things that I’m like wtf. First she was like “are you shy” and I asked what she meant. Then she said “are you shy around women” and I said no. She laughed and told me I had to get naked and as soon as I did she made a noise and said “you must have a bunch of ladies chasing you around.” So then I said “it doesn’t help with suicidal ideation” and she said “you wouldn’t think someone with all those ladies would be suicidal”. (This is the only quote I’m paraphrasing because I can’t remember exactly what she said but something weird like that.) But isn’t that a weird thing to say, especially when you consider how mentally unstable I was? My partner is really not happy about the fact that this happened, I also think it’s weird but I’ve got other stuff to deal with. But I was in such a poor mental condition and really freaked out by getting there when the lights were out and they wouldn’t let me make a phone call.

1jbmpdm,1742011221.0,Is it normal to get extremely depressed attempting to recover repressed memories?,"So I don’t actually know if I have repressed memories. I have reasons to believe it’s possible but absolutely zero memory of any type of incident. I was seriously depressed from ages 9ish to 18, attempted at 18, moved states, then spontaneously recovered from depression with the move. My mother made a comment that she was concerned I had repressed memories (were positive my dad had repressed memories of SA, and the similarities in our experiences are concerning) and so I started deep diving into it. It has made my depression take a steep dive. Disassociation isn’t uncommon for me, but has gotten more severe. Anger issues were present at around 6-14 then I became incredibly docile and theyve returned with a shocking intensity. I tried backing off the ‘repressed memories’ lane, but it hasn’t helped. I’ve had nightmares for a long time and sleep issues, but those i wouldn’t say have gotten any better or worse, except for one concerning dream that ended with my mother (the person I feel closest and safest around) telling me to stop digging into the issue and that I don’t want to look further.

1jbmms4,1742010977.0,Derealization and depersonalization,"Hey there. I recently wrote a comment in response to a post that was deleted shortly after. Here it is, slightly changed.

Whether it is derealization or depersonalization, the distinction is rather intricate; both belong to dissociative disorder, which already is pretty much a spectrum. 

Derealization is essentially loosing intimate familiarity with objects you know while still recognizing them intellectually. Depersonalization is far more frightening, since it is basically the same thing, but it applies to your sense of self. Perhaps, they originate from the same malfunction in your mind, read your physiology, but are distinct enough to be classified as different symptoms. I had both; now it’s only - though not as intense, frequent and frightening as it used to be - depersonalization episodes.

When a person, especially a child is routinely subjected to psychological trauma the brain learns how to protect itself from it by dissociating, but not just by making you somewhat inattentive to the harmful environment. That too, but something far more consequential is taking place, something that at some point reveals itself as a qualitative change in perception of objects or your self, or both, though not necessarily at the same time.

Very few specialists can explain it with greater precision. And I am not even formally educated in this or any other field. All I have regarding this matter is decent understanding of a very difficult subject in philosophy called consciousness of self, learned online, from various resources. The philosopher who contributed the most to this subject is Immanuel Kant; the book that explained the most about it is Critique of Pure Reason - a notoriously difficult read. The part of it where you can find the most of his presentation of the subject is infamous Transcendental Deduction of Categories of Pure Understanding, a virtually impenetrable text. There, you can find his account of the origins of self, called Transcendental Unity of Apperception. It is, at least doctrinally, reflected in modern neuroscience.

If you want to learn a few things about self consciousness within the framework of speculative philosophy, it is going to be a long road. And ultimately, the destination is not even in sight. We simply do not know substantially more about what yields consciousness than philosophers of post enlightenment knew centuries ago.

My advice is, call a psychologist after a psychologist until you hear his competence in dissociative disorder. For the lack of anything better, refer to this post. Don’t buy any assurances that a person is an ace of every mental illness, normally found in his online profile, prior to the actual conversation with this professional.

This condition is not the most crippling of them all, but a very difficult thing to understand, for the reasons I already disclosed. You are not the only person to have it. However, different people are affected by it differently. Being an early teenager, in the country where you simply do not talk about your mental issues and at the time when it was a bigger stigma than it is now, I was terrified by it. My short moments of depersonalization would be accompanied by commercial grade panic attacks. When it comes to discrete mental experiences, nothing is scarier than losing normal perception of your self.

Good luck to you and many thanks to your supportive loved ones for their care for you, I know how hard it is for them to even try to understand you.

1jbln85,1742007434.0,I wanna cry but I can't. I am scared. I don't know what to do.,"So many times I jump out of my bed because I feel as if I die. I feel that when I jump out of my bed I prevent myself from dying. I don't know what causes it. Is it the mental stress I am going through?

I fall asleep and in that second gasp for air. I have to force my brain to let me breathe.

My limbs feel numb. My blood feels as if it doesn't flow anymore. I jump out of my bed and force my body to work again.

What is that? I am scared. Do I call an ambulance? Do I grab my bicycle and ride to the hospital? The doctors will be annoyed that I come at night after 3 am. It's 3 am right now while I type this out. Is it a simple panic attack? I have this often. More than I would like to have which is zero. It's at least 3 out of 7 nights I go through that. Is it because my body is alert because of my screaming housemate? This mostly happens when it's quiet. When he screams at night I don't have those symptoms.

But I also am thinking of what if I go to sleep? Will I have those symptoms again? And that scares me. Do I trigger them with my overthinking? I mean, I can trigger a panic attack by just thinking about having one.

Or am I having a heart attack? I hope not. My heart is racing or at least beating a bit harder lately when I just changed my position in bed. It's almost 4 am now. It took me a solid hour to post this.

1jbh3z3,1741993740.0,"34 male, I feel a void in my life and I’m not sure where to begin","So I came on here today because there was some things I wanted to get off my chest, and I’m not sure if this is social anxiety or me just being introverted or what. So I guess I’ll start off with telling you a little bit about myself. 

I’m 34, male and I live in the USA. I work a job in an office, I don’t want to go into details due to privacy, but it does involve calling customers on the phone. I live alone, I own a small house, and as far as the adulting things are concerned  such as saving and being responsible I’m pretty good at those things. I save, invest, I take great interest in it actually I enjoy reading Articles of that nature and financial podcasts. 

The one area of my life where there’s a void you could say would be the social aspect of my life. I socialize a little bit with coworkers, but that’s pretty much my only socialization. I don’t hang out with anyone outside of work, most people are doing their own thing. I don’t have any friends and I haven’t really had a true friend since high school but I haven’t sought out one either I guess aside from apps here and there. I’ve never been in a relationship in my entire life. Once in 2014 I met a girl online and we went on I guess it was a sort of date or more like hanging out, we saw a movie and ate at the food court but it was just one time that’s it. I literally have not done anything else at all. 

On a typical week where I work Monday thru Friday, the only thing I’ll do on the weekend is go to the gym for maybe an hour on Saturday then an hour on Sunday. I do grocery shopping once every other 2 weeks. I went to a movie theater by myself today cause I had PTO from work saw a movie and treated myself to a meal at the food court. It was by myself, like everything else. Work and gym are the only things that give me some kind of purpose in life, work because the dream that my hard work will eventually materialize to higher up positions or open new doors and working out because it feels empowering to get stronger. 

Sometimes when someone says hi to me, I’m like “hi…” like it’s a strain to say it. My voice will become higher pitched hard to describe. I remember looking through my peephole on a day off to wait to go outside when my neighbors aren’t outside. I mean I don’t know if I’m just overthinking things or maybe this is a useless rant, I just feel a void inside I guess. A void that I mask with things like streaming shows movies or mindlessly scrolling on my phone on apps like this and elsewhere. 

I’ve tried dating apps but if you’re a guy you know what it’s like but idk I guess don’t get any matches so nothing I can do. I guess maybe there’s a part of me that enjoys being introverted but maybe some social interaction would be ok maybe?

1jbnrwk,1742015103.0,"I'm only 14, Idk what to do anymore.","My life is going downhill so fast and I don't know what to do anymore. My whole childhood and up until about a year ago I was being abused physically, sexually, and mentally by my dad, I was finally able to live with my mom full time (who i love so so much) but she got with her boyfriend around the same time. Everything was okay at first but then her boyfriend completely moved in and very quickly it was obvious that he is not a good person at all. He's always very mean to her and drinks a lot, and when he drinks he gets extremely violent. He's beaten her up more times than i can count and has tried to beat me up too, he even gave her 2 black eyes and threatened to kill her on Christmas eve. Every time this happens he leaves for like 2 days tops and she says she's done with him but then he's back and she says that he's gonna change, stop drinking and go to anger management (none of which has happened.) 

I started smoking weed like 3 years ago and it very quickly escalated to worse drugs. I was addicted to dilaudid for many months but was able to stop when I moved in with my mom. Luckily i was then put on medication for my anxiety and everything seemed to be getting better but then obviously her boyfriend happened and I started drinking more. I've been drinking a lot more lately since the last time he moved in and my mental health has been getting so much worse, im always either drinking, starving myself, or binging on food just to throw it up.

It’s always there. Every single day, I find myself arguing in my head, defending myself—not because I did anything wrong, but because I feel like something was taken away from me. Like my rights were taken. It’s like my mind is stuck in this endless fight, trying to get justice. But nothing changes. It’s exhausting.
Sometimes, I even dream about it. And when I wake up, it starts all over again.

I don’t feel satisfied with my life at all. I feel like I’m living in extreme unfairness. My mind has become strange. It’s like it’s no longer mine. There’s no space for peace or focus on reality my brain keeps dragging me back to the same topic, over and over. This forces me to compare myself with others, making the unfairness I feel even more painful.
It feels like my mind is getting lighter, like I’m losing it. Like my brain is slipping away from me.

This situation is making me mentally sick. I feel depressed, anxious, and angry all the time. It’s like my emotions are spiraling, and I can’t stop it. No matter how hard I try to focus on the present or think about something else, my head pulls me back into this mess.

There are so many things I want to say about what’s happening, and so many questions I wish I could ask, but I’m too scared. I’m scared to even ask I’m scared of the answers will hurt more.

1jbgivy,1741992117.0,questions on olanzapine and antipsychotic side effects,"So I'm diagnosed with ADHD and have C-PTSD. All the meds I've taken (Adderall 10mg, Vyvanse 10mg, Lexapro 5mg/7.5mg, Concerta 27/36mg) have caused me to have these 'episodes' where I deal with intrusive delusional thoughts and unstable mood swings. Concerta 18mg was actually nice in the sense it gave me a high, but I wasn't productive on it. Hydroxyzine 10-20mg helps me calm down at least.

I tried Olanzapine 2.5mg yesterday, and my mind isn't in turmoil anymore. It's a relief that I feel calm and normal for once. This feels like a good thing, but I started reading other people's experiences on reddit/drugs.com. Their withdrawal symptoms are scary, and it seems like it can cause permanent severe insomnia (along with brain shrinkage in some studies?). It seems this can also happen with just a few weeks usage.

My psychiatrist didn't tell me this, he just said olanzapine was going to be a nervous system regulator for me at night. I'm thinking that I definitely don't want to take it for two weeks consistently (before our next appt). I would rather take Seroquel if it seems like antipsychotics would truly help me.

As the title says, I need serious help. Talking to my family isn't an option and I don't have any psychiatrist in the small city I live in. Biggest thing for me is that most of the time I don't even feel like going out of my
room and saying hi to my family. And when I do I have to force myself to pretend that I care. Only escape for me is playing video games, which also makes me so dependent on them to the point that my sole focus is playing them. And in return because of them I developed severe social
anxiety that when I even think about work I feel like crying, just having
to go and socialize with so many people there, and having less time
for video games is bad for my mental health. But I need to stop playing them, I feel like if I do it will push me to get serious about my life but I haven't made the courage to do that. And the thing is I have friends who care about me but I don't feel loved or anything close to that, I would go on call with a friend for hours and have a fun time but the second I close that call my smile fades and I become severely depressed. I honestly
don't know what to do with my life. I thought about suicide once and
the thought of experiencing new games is what kept me from seriously
considering ending my life, that and I don't have the courage to do it.
The thing is as well I have worked before, it's good first month or so, but anything more than that is where I start to sink in this hole that I can't crawl out from. Everyday with work becomes even more of hell than it
already is. One thing I get from work is money which barely provides any happiness. Buying things for myself doesn't do anything for my mental health, and because I haven't worked for 4 months now my parents keep pushing on me to go work, and because I had a lot of personal problem with my parents which I haven't talked to them about, keeps bottling
inside me and all the anger comes out on them, which after everything,they don't deserve. My depression also prevented me from working out and I've gained weight which makes me even more depressed and I'm such a fuckup and idiot that I cant even be serious about working out at home at least. Honestly there's a ton more I can write about but the main thing I think i need is work, getting away from my parents aka
living alone and finally start making something out of this miserable life.But I don't have the strength to do it. Last couple of weeks even getting out of bed and sleeping are hard. So I hope some of you guys can give me some advice because I really need to hear it.

I’ll feel better tomorrow, but the contrasts between the concert and the night home is so overwhelming. It’s like you feel so euphoric and happy at a concert, that when it’s over, you crash down. Like I’m using up all my serotonin and dopamine, and I’m stuck feeling blue afterwards and there’s no serotonin left in my brain. Just needed to vent, or maybe ask for an explanation or others experiences. I don’t want to stop going to concerts, I have so much fun, but it makes me so sad.

I hate how I conviced myself no one will find me attractive if I am fat and full of scars and what else. Now that it might have happened, I just think of the worst: Maybe he is just desperate and wants to throw up at the sight of my body- hence why I think he actually never finishes when he's with me, probably just fakes it for the sake of mocking me because I probably look like a desperate femcel with daddy issues. Maybe he also replays my snaps to send it to his friends and make fun of me. Or maybe he isn't even who he says he is and in reality he's an insane dude who will doxx me if I reject him or unalive me soon. How do I know he's actually who he claims to be? That his job and whatever are not a lie?  The fact is that I shouldn't even care, because if we both just jerk off and then live our lives it shouldn't matter- I should think about myself and myself only. But it's impossible when I have this kind of disorder and feel everything 100x times stronger. Ffs, I walk slowly alongside pigeons to not scare them while they cross the sidewalk, how am I supposed to not care about someone who seems my fatass naked? This is all giving me the worst anxiety.

1jbk4xz,1742002600.0,Left this subreddit because I was doing great and was dating an amazing woman. Now we’re broken up and I’m devastated.,"Hey everyone, in November I met the most beautiful woman in the world and almost immediately we hit it off and fell in love. Three months later we broke up and it wasn’t pretty and quite honestly the relationship was toxic with a ton of red flags that I missed. I was doing so good and my mental health was at an all time high when we started dating initially but now, I’m crying everyday, I’m putting on fake smiles everywhere I go, and I want to break but I know I can’t.

I hope I’m not too screwed up from the relationship that I have trouble trusting my next partner because it’s happened to people I know and it took them a while to recover. I just want to forget about her and her kids, her parents, and her friends but I can’t right now. The whole relationship she made me feel like I wasn’t doing enough and that I was the bad guy. She never took responsibility for things she did that bothered me, she was controlling while accusing me of trying to be controlling at times. I should’ve never dated her if I’m being honest but I can’t change the past and I’m having trouble moving on. 

I felt that leaving this subreddit was a proud moment but now I’m back trying to find things to make me laugh or to help cope with the pain. It doesn’t help that she broke up with me while my father was dying. Honestly, I’m at peace with my dad’s death but it sucks not having someone to be there to help you through it. I’m honestly not okay but I hope this camping trip I’m taking tomorrow helps me. Love you all.

1jbk4r1,1742002583.0,"I keep having some kind of attack during dialysis treatment, help please","I have a doctors appointment in a few weeks, and I plan to speak with him about this. But I was hoping you guys could help me understand this a little bit more in the meantime. 

&nbsp;  

I was put on dialysis last September, and since then I keep having these panic or anxiety attacks during treatment. I have done research but these attacks are different from what I keep reading about, so It's been difficult for me to pinpoint what is happening to me.

&nbsp; 

Panic attacks and anxiety run in my family. The kind where they feel intense fear. But with mine, I don't feel fear. I feel like I am fighting someone. A good way to describe it, as someone has told me, is it is like I am fighting myself. My muscles tense up, I sweat, I can't stop moving my legs, I squeeze my hands, and I breathe really fast. I feel this push and pull within myself. I literally just want to fight. If I wasn't tied to that chair by my blood, I think I would try to stand up and fight someone. So yes, I do feel like I'm fighting myself, to keep from getting up and fighting with someone else. 

I sometimes cry too but that's probably more from some undiagnosed depression. And embarrassment. I can't figure out what the trigger is. The needles don't bother me or even hurt that much, and I'm not worried about anything before the attacks come on. These attacks last around 10 minutes usually. I don't have any fear, and nothings abnormal going on in my head during the attacks. I can talk and even hold conversations like normal, I just can't control my body. 

I am so grateful that I don't have the fear type of anxiety/panic, those sound horrible, but whatever I do have can still be dangerous because they keep happening during treatment while I have two very large needles in my arm and I can't keep control of my body. Does this problem sound familiar to anyone? Can someone shine some light on it for me? Will I need to speak to a psychiatrist instead of my PCP for this?

Currently I’m thinking not a big deal because it always goes away. Usually the mania is pretty motivating but my parents have suggested therapy/medications. I feel this may due to being more distant and short with them, so they started to pay attention. I started doing this because I feel very judged by them but I understand how they could see it as a sign to keep an eye on me. I think mental health struggles are just part of being human and I just need to figure out how to navigate life differently.

1jbiuk9,1741998684.0,My (26f) boyfriend (30f) pissed me off so much that I wanna physically fight. Help me.,"⚠️Trigger warning ⚠️ talks of su*cide, self harm, and jail

Before you come out with the ""breakup"" comments. I know. I know I shouldn't be with him but the relationship advice isn't about ""us"" it's about me.

I feel so narcissistic. All I've ever done is care about myself. Even with therapy,  brief jail time for physical violence, and anger management, there's still something wrong with me. I don't know what to do.

There's lots of things in my relationship that make me upset is just stupid-guy-brain shit. 

My bf (30m.. sorry I was upset when typing) doesn't listen to me. I say stuff and he never remembers. His go to phrase is always ""you never told me that.. you never said that"". I've told him time and time again that I don't like when he blames me for things. When it's a conversation about what he's told me, I'm always lying. It's always ""you're just lying... I never said that"". The times I get mad after he tells that, he just stays quiet and ignores me. When I can't see him he'll be like ""that guy never called me... when were we supposed to go to that thing?"" and I turn around to answer him to be like ""what are you talking about"", and he's on phone with his mom or dad. I've told him time and time again that he never talks when he makes me upset because he always just wants to change the subject after a fight and act like nothing happened. When I try to talk about it and say not to change the subject he gets quiet again and when I tell him to speak it's always ""I was just about to but keep talking"". I feel like I'm going insane. This is routine of arguments but instead of just getting mad or breaking up. All of this happens EVERY SINGLE TIME WE FIGHT. I'm so sick of it. I can't take it no more.

I want to throw and break shit. I want to fight him. I've banged my head against furniture and walls because I'm just so over stimulated. I've recommended couples counseling and nothing. I've been working on myself for years. I've gone to therapy and opened up about everything I've done. I've been to anger management. My family has said that I've been doing so well but these arguments make me want to go back to my old self. I don't want to be like this. I have to leave... but why? Why am I like this? I've been trying not go back to violence but I feel like I'm going crazy. I honestly want to go to a clinic, rehab, anything. I don't like this part of me. I want to be happy but all this has been happening so fucking often. What do I do about my narcism? Why do I only give a shit about myself. I don't know what to do anymore. I thought my anger was getting better. I thought my depression was getting better. I suffered from suicide attempts and cutting from my teenage years and I don't want to go back. I speak to my therapist and I don't know what to do. I have a job I don't want to lose. I have friends I don't want to lose. My family. I just need help, please.

1jbicw4,1741997256.0,How do I go about asking for screening?,"I think this is a stupid question but I'm not sure.

  
For a long time now I always felt like my doctor missed something when diagnosing me, and I am honestly beginning to believe I may be on the spectrum or be neurodivergent. 

  
I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at around 11, I'm 20 now and have had the same psychiatrist since. I don't have a therapist, but I speak with my psychiatrist every 3 months. For a few years I've been wanting to bring up and ask about being screened for Autism or ADHD, but I just feel really stupid about it for some reason. 

  
I'm not really sure what to say or how to bring it up, I'm worried she'll dismiss me or something because all that was ""figured out"" already... When we talk, it's usually major updates and she asks me about my anxiety levels and depression, and the appointments are 30 minute televisits, so I've never had enough time to really tell her about the things that make me feel this way. I don't want her to think I'm just bringing it up out of nowhere.



My next appointment is this month, but again, I'm just worried it'll feel like it's out of nowhere. I don't know why I'm so worked up about it but any advice helps. My depression and anxiety both have ""fizzled"" out a whole lot since I was young, and I've grown up a lot these past few years, but all that's done is make that feeling of ""something is not right"" worse, I feel like I've become a lot more aware of these other symptoms or something.

1jbicds,1741997215.0,Struggling with Growth,"Hi, my name is zay and im 18yrs old. Im writing this because.. I have no clue what to do anymore. I’m too poor for therapy and I don’t fully trust my friends.. I feel like I have no one. I feel like I’ve been stuck in the same cycle for years, and no matter what I do, I always end up back in the same place. I have a lot of issues I want to work on, but I don’t even know where to start, and it feels like everything I do is just surface level change. I can never seem to take any accountability, only react afterwards with anger and self pity… its pathetic yes. I’ve considered killing myself on my birthday for the last few years…I never go through but I imagine scenarios of the reaction— but also writing some grand note. A big part of it comes from my childhood. I never had a father figure growing up he left before I was born and has a new family now. I try to ignore it, but it eats at me. I see the life he has with them, and I hate how jealous and angry I feel. Growing up all I had was my grandfather and I love him.. but he’s getting older I feel like he’s slipping away when I need him most. My mom was emotionally manipulative and struggled with addiction when I was younger, and I spent time in foster care before living with my grandparents. And I do understand she had a hard childhood.. it mirrors eachother.. me and hers, my grandmother had an addiction problem and.. My spent alot of time in and out of prison.. on the streets. She’s sober now, and I know I should let go of the resentment, but i feel like can’t. Even when I try, the feelings don’t go away. I even have resentment towards her for the fact we’re poor.. which isn’t her fault. I just struggling ever month.. it’s either food or the rent.. we don’t even have a car right now. All of this has shaped the way I see myself, and it’s not in a good way. I don’t feel like a real man. I compare myself to other men constantly and always feel like I’ll never measure up. I struggle with my emotions I either feel things too intensely, or I just go numb and shut down. I also have a habit of self-sabotage and being impulsive, especially when I feel like I’m losing control. I say things I don’t mean, I act in ways I regret, and then I get stuck in a cycle of guilt and self-hatred. I don’t want to keep hurting myself or the people around me, but I don’t know how to stop. I feel I’ve never felt love and I can’t even love myself.. I don’t know what it feels like more, I don’t even feel it towards my mother especially.. or my grandfather or my other family. I feel like my life is gonna be miserable.. like im stuck like this. where do I even start? How do you break out of cycles when they feel like all you’ve ever known? Please, if you have any advice..

1jb97ox,1741972768.0,„Insanity episodes“. I have no idea what‘s going on and I‘m scared,"I (M, 19) been having some hard times where I feel like I‘m genuinely going insane. I struggle to describe it and I haven‘t ever heard of something remotely similar.

I have diagnosed anxiety and depression, although I thought both was improving a lot. 
But I sometimes I have these „flare-ups“ of intense mental/emotional discomfort.

During them, I can hardly focus and feel restless. I sometimes feel like bursting into tears. Nothing is fun or appealing anymore. Everything & everyone is irritating and too much. Things feel out of place and even my comfort content feels odd and bring me little to no relief. 
Any content about bad mental health immediately makes these feelings far worse, even just the thought of it.

These episodes go away on their own, but it is the scariest thing I‘ve ever experienced and it terrifies me.

I just keep telling myself over and over again that it‘ll pass and better moments will come. And I cling to my comfort content even if it barely helps. 

I‘d be insanely grateful for *any* advice or comfort or someone who maybe has an explanation for these confusing and scary feelings. Maybe it‘s just being a teen and if so, I would love some reassurance that it‘ll get better.

I am diagnosed mdd, ptsd and anxiety disorder.

Backstory: I (33 f) and my husband (31 m) grew up in the same small town. We had a super rough relationship the entire time until about 4-5 years ago. I had a young child when we got together and he decided to raise her as his child. My father doesn't speak to us because we have different religious beliefs (none) than him and if it's not his way,  bye. My mom is an alcoholic. She does a lot for us financially, but the things she says when drinking, are very detrimental to my own mental health. My husband's family (paternal)is ....different. This is not to speak ill of them. I will just say they aren't the most supportive or affectionate. Hence * why we moved away. My son (12) has asd and a bunch of other dx. He was harmed at school by a teacher, so I pulled him out and quit my job. My husband got a job that put us in a stable(not well off) enough place that we wouldn't struggle too much. But he works over the road so we don't get to spend time together. Fast forward to now, we had a 3rd baby 11 years after the last and i just cannot recover neither has our relationship. She is 14 months old.
Today *

My oldest (14 female) left me crying in the front yard earlier because I asked her to stay out with me and the baby for a few minutes. She would rather rot in her room than spend 1 minute with me. The only time I get with her is when I'm driving her to sports, appointments, her friends or when I force her. 

My son got mad because I was making him so school work so he intentionally tried to start an argument with my husband in the hopes to get me yelled at. 

I have no physical help with my baby or the upkeep of the house. 

I'm dead inside. I literally am like a machine. I just do stuff for everyone else and rot inside. Nobody sees me. Nobody helps me. I ask for help. I say ""I need help"" and nobody comes. I do have a mental health provider but I cannot see her for $70 per visit, plus 40 for my meds every month plus $75 for my insuance....

1jbghd9,1741992003.0,Why do I feel so emotionless and strange?,"Hey, so im a teenager (female) and over the past 3-6 months ive been getting this weird feeling of just pure emotionless. I know lots of people just say it’s apart of growing up, but this feels different. Like for example, bit of a dark topic but my cat, 2 grandparents and another relative all died within the same month, I was close to all of them. However I felt nothing at all, like it was just another normal day. I didn’t shed a tear, I just shrugged it off. People say this can been seen as a way of grieving, but I don’t miss them at all. Another example, when my parents are worried about me or something, they were crying about it and hugging me, felt nothing at all. It’s just the same exact feeling, like pure emptiness. But there’s 2 other things I feel, i feel a strange hatred towards everything. I hate my parents, no reason at all. I hate being around friends, just anything I hate it. Last thing, anything that seems upsetting, harms others or affects someone else like, making them loose their friends, it’s just pure amusement to me. If my friend were to loose all their friends, I’d find it extremely amusing and just laugh about it. Same with the emotionless stuff, I started to laugh about it, like when I get told something extremely upsetting, it just makes me laugh. I also find it really easy to mask someone’s emotions or personality. I can copy someone’s personality easily, it’s so strange. One last extremely strange thing, I do find harm and violence quite amusing to me, I could easily watch someone harm themselves and I’d find it very amusing for some reason.

I know this is a lot to read, but genuinely I need help. Is there something wrong with me? I don’t feel normal, I’ve felt like this for so long. I’m not diagnosed with any mental illnesses, please any thoughts on this??

1jbg3vq,1741990998.0,Your favorite piece of visual art,"[\\""Untitled\\"" Mark Rothko ](https://preview.redd.it/oldat1jk8qoe1.jpg?width=258&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e6460eabe215f0645deb4ca8e12d935ffd9204)

Since about age of 15, when I started realizing the state of my mental health, I had found a comfort in both creating and appreciating art - mostly visual one. I was diagnosed with depression and BPD. When my thoughts turn dark, I turn to art for support. When for some reason my situation gets worse (for example, when I stop taking medication) I lose interest in art and find it hard to paint, seeing as my skill disintegrates, inspiration and motivation leaves my mind and therefore suicide thoughts arise. If I don't commit to them, instead search for help in medication, support from mom or therapy, my will to create comes back and I believe as long I have this desire to paint, the less I want to stop existing. As an amateur painter, I obviously also appreciate other people's art. Sometimes, when doing this, I come across works that really resonate with me and get stuck in my mind. “Untitled” by Mark Rothko (also known as “Black on grey”) is one of them. 

​Many people attempt to present depression through art but I often find it hard to relate to them. However, when I found Rothko's art piece, it struck me and made me feel for the first time in my life that there was possibly a person who understood me and went through the same experiences. Rothko the same year he painted “Black on grey”, had committed suicide when he lost to depression. Even though his artworks are rather vague and therefore interpretations differ, I really want to believe that that one painting was made to showcase the same feelings (or rather lack of them) I have, making it very special for me and so my favorite. 

​I want to ask you, what's your favorite piece of visual art? One that you possibly find comfort in, relate to or simply appreciate, makes you feel pleased, terrified or understood. Thank you for reading this.

1jbg089,1741990726.0,"Anti-depressants aren't working, I think","
Hello , I'm sixteen years old and I've started anti-depressants. Due to being underweight I was originally started on 25mg but I had a massive break down which resulted in my dose getting upped.

I will admit, near the beginning of my dosage being upped I was feeling more motivated and happier in myself, ultimately my grades were rising, my friends were noticing my change in mood but after a while I just feel almost disconnected. I'll have these periods of feeling my lowest of lows to the point I think of ending my life -- I even self harmed again after being nine months clean. I feel like I'm getting worse on these meds and like they aren't even working.

I just feel 'empty' despite how corny that word is but it describes me best at the moment. I cant sleep, I can't eat, I can't socialise. I just can't do anything anymore.

I don't want to be stuck feeling this way anymore, I just want to live my life instead of being tied down to these thoughts. I want to be like everyone else, achieving their dreams and able to see a future ahead of themselves.

I can't help but feel like I'm not going to be here any longer. Nothing helps me, no matter what. These anti-depressants were the last thread of hope I had left. No amount of therapy helps me, cbt, crisis team, cahms and all that shit. I just feel hopeless and that maybe this is the end for me.

1jbflfj,1741989620.0,“Are we friends?” The question that healed an old wound,"So yesterday my neighbor asked me “are we friends?” And I (38F) felt like this was a weird question considering I’ve made it a point to show many love languages to her  (not the romantic kind but the kindness to someone I came to care about.). I make sure she’s doing okay since she has some medical issues. I’ve given her some really helpful things for her period (thermal care and some awesome pads that use essential oil to help with pain). Not just the cup of obligatory sugar. So obviously I said “yes” and she started to tell me why she asked but got distracted by a text and went off on a tangent about something completely different. I’m not complaining about not knowing what she was about to tell me. But before I left I made sure to say again that we are friends. Then I was sitting at home getting my son to sleep and really processed the face that she wanted to be sure we are friends. And this memory of pain came surging back into my mind. 

In high school my freshman year the very last class of my day was P.E./ health and I knew no one in this class. No friends from middle school no kids from other classes earlier. No one. so I sat near these girls who seemed nice enough and we started talking. So the next day I sat by them again and did this for the rest of the week but by the middle of the following week one of them turned to me when I sat by them and flat out said “ you know we are not friends right?” 
Shocked is putting it lightly 
I had talked with them for days. We had laughed together. We had exchanged stories. I didn’t think they were part of my inner circle or I in theirs. But not friends in any way. I wanted to cry but you can’t because you can’t cry in school. So I just moved away and sat by myself. I was hurt. I continued to be hurt. I finished the semester.

1jbflag,1741989611.0,Can you truly be content with the idea of dying and leaving no guilt behind?,"I'm in my mid-30's and whilst I'm not 'suicidal', I'm almost exhausted with life and would like to have an open conversation about my feelings on death. This is not intended to be a morbid chat at all, I'm not in a dangerous position, nor do I need 'rescuing', I just generally want an adult conversation about my feelings. 

Aside from the idea of not being with my pet dog and the emotional trauma I feel my parents would take on, I have absolutely no guilt that if I took my life tomorrow, that it would affect anyone else's life around me. I honestly believe it would sadden people I know, but that in a few years I wouldn't be talked about, I'm just not that memorable.

  
I've had a difficult few years, lost my business, my partner and a gradual snowball of bad luck. I've always been on fairly low income and don't have the 'security' of savings to fall back on or even to 'treat' myself, or enough money to move somewhere new to start again. I just get by, work hard and give whatever I can to others - I'm the friend that everyone has and would be there for anything they need, but when the role is flipped, nobody seems to show the same level of support I expect in return.

  
I've come to resent my 'friendships' and come off all social media as it was unhealthy to compare my situation to others. I realised that my phone is quiet and goes dusty as a result. Before you assume anything, I spent the last year reaching out to everyone I could, asking for support and help when I was in a really difficult place - I'm almost forgotten, it's become evident and I've accepted it. I'm at a point now that after months of job rejections and no financial/housing assistance from authorities, that I just have run out of energy to care. I'm not miserable, I just have accepted that maybe this life isn't for me anymore and I don't feel bad about it in a way.

  
My parents have tried to support me through recent times, but we don't talk in detail, we're not that type of family to share emotions in detail. They know the hardships and of course they love me and vice versa. If I died, they'd go into a rut of depression and I'm sure it'd hurt them incredibly hard, nothing would fix that. If they were a lot older, it'd be easier to accept I reckon.

  
But aside from them, I don't feel bad about anyone else that knows me. Is that understandable? Of course I respect that it's awful for emergency services to deal with a body, so taking your life is never going to be 'pretty', but how else can you just 'slip away' from this world in contentment?

  
I've given everything I can - to family, relationships, friends, community groups, workplaces, etc. It's not like I haven't lived a life either, I've had fun and I've had experiences. Like I say, I'm not currently acting on this, nor am I sat in a dark room depressed and emotional. I'm a rational woman, sat in a comfy chair with a cup of tea in hand, just describing the part of life I feel at.

What do people think about this mindset? Is it understandable at all?

For context im 19 NB and after a diffcult relatioship i first discoverd that in high stress situations i comfert my self by speaking out loud with out full control i hated myself for it as i saw it as a cheap replication of DID which my friend has and i thought i was copying to feel special. Later aftef another relation this time with a person with DID i emnd up breaking down so much i again reflexively  start comferting myself till i feel diffent

This is where i feel this ""friend"" truly manifested as some sort of cope. I used it to talk to my friend who was comferting me and try to deescalate while i felt fully conscious i felt a detachment from my emotions to the point i didnt know if i really was me. 

Now fast forward their are 3 voices i guess one being a being of my past basicly pure anxity , another one being a logical emotionless decision  maker who helps me toughen up and a kind carring one who wierdly has feeling for me and i sometimes have feelings for it which feels gross and i hate it and to people im comfertable with i will act as  one of those people and speak un a voice i imagen for them and i hate it calms me down

The main calm voice is really the only thing stoping my suside and self harm so i need it but i know its just me comferting myself but i just can't imagen loving myself so having wn imagenary partner is really the only way.

So what is this, what is wrong with me i see these things as basicly emotional states where i change my feeling but dont actully change person i have gained after working on it an easy way of switching but again it just feels like a fucked up copy of DID so i can be quirky

1jbah6e,1741976500.0,Helping My Brother (MD/PhD) Process His Psychotic Illness & Move Forward,"Hi everyone,

I’m posting again because my family is still searching for the right path forward for my older brother. If anyone has experience, insight, or guidance, please share—we’re desperate to help him.

**Background**

My brother, a brilliant and accomplished MD/PhD, has been struggling with what we believe to be some psychotic disorder. His decline began in 2022 after a lawsuit and removal from his academic program, but it has escalated rapidly since. He believes he is being ""punished"" by the world, convinced that an unseen force is orchestrating his life against him. At first, he thought specific people (his ex-wife, employer, landlord) were conspiring against him, but now, it’s a broader belief in a ""world governing body"" controlling everything- especially him. He lost his career and every single one of his relationships/friendships and, at one point, lived in total isolation without electricity, paranoid that his landlord was spying on him and working with higher powers too. He was involuntarily hospitalized in early 2023 for two weeks but refused further treatment and cut contact for nearly a year. 

Since mid-2024, we've been actively supporting him, and he has lived at home (CA) with us. He is no longer in the paranoid, manic state he once was—his behavior is much calmer and more stable. However, his core delusion of being ""controlled"" still persists, and it prevents him from fully engaging in life or trying new things.

The key difference now is that **we have his trust**. He believes that we have more insight into whatever is ""controlling"" him than he does, so we have been able to negotiate with him to follow our guidance. Because of this, he has been **listening to us, taking his medication, and following the structure we put in place**—even though he doesn’t fully understand or agree with it.

**Where We Are Now**

* **Medication:** He has tried Abilify (fatigue) and Latuda (irritability). Now, he’s on Caplyta (5mg) but still insists, “Everyone knows I’m not sick, yet I have to take meds that make me sick.”
* **Therapy:** He has agreed to meet a therapist next week who has experience with psychosis, but we’re unsure how to track his progress.
* **Physical Training:** Works with a trainer twice weekly for structure and motivation.
*  **Mindset:** He knows something is “missing” but believes the cause is external. He wants his life back but doesn’t think medication or therapy is the answer.

**Key Questions**

1. Who can best help him understand his illness? His doctor hasn’t diagnosed him officially. At what point should someone help him process his condition?
2. He feels like this has only happened to him. Can anyone relate?
3. How do we help him distinguish past misfortune from illness-related experiences? Should we show evidence from his worst period (2021–2023) to help him understand?
4.  Since he follows structure but doesn’t believe he’s sick, how do we determine if/when he needs medication?

He is willing to take steps forward, but everything about recovery feels counterintuitive to him (as he is certain the problem is external, not internal). What worked if you’ve been through something similar with a loved one? What resources helped?

Thank you so much. We’re really hoping to find a way to help him get him and his life back - whatever that new version might be like. ",1,3,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jbah6e/helping_my_brother_mdphd_process_his_psychotic/,hi everyone im posting family still searching right path forward older brother anyone experience insight guidance please sharewere desperate help background brother brilliant accomplished mdphd struggling believe psychotic disorder decline began lawsuit removal academic program escalated rapidly since believes punished world convinced unseen force orchestrating life first thought specific people exwife employer landlord conspiring broader belief world governing body controlling everything especially lost career every single one relationshipsfriendships one point lived total isolation without electricity paranoid landlord spying working higher powers involuntarily hospitalized early two weeks refused treatment cut contact nearly year since mid weve actively supporting lived home ca us longer paranoid manic state washis behavior much calmer stable however core delusion controlled still persists prevents fully engaging life trying new things key difference trust believes insight whatever controlling able negotiate follow guidance listening us taking medication following structure put placeeven though doesnt fully understand agree medication tried abilify fatigue latuda irritability hes caplyta mg still insists everyone knows im sick yet take meds make sick therapy agreed meet therapist next week experience psychosis unsure track progress physical training works trainer twice weekly structure motivation mindset knows something missing believes cause external wants life back doesnt think medication therapy answer key questions best help understand illness doctor hasnt diagnosed officially point someone help process condition feels like happened anyone relate help distinguish past misfortune illnessrelated experiences show evidence worst period help understand since follows structure doesnt believe hes sick determine ifwhen needs medication willing take steps forward everything recovery feels counterintuitive certain problem external internal worked youve something similar loved one resources helped thank much really hoping find way help get life back whatever new version might like
1jbad01,1741976053.0,"Anxiety, feeling hopeless and scared","So last night I had a horrible headache, went to ER at 2 am, got even worse and then the scary thoughts attacked me. Thoughts like ""I'll always be in pain"", ""I'll always be alone"", ""there's no one who could come here rn and tell me all will be ok"" etc etc. My sister had problems last year and was institutionalized for 2 months, she's still struggling but is on meds and she's working, has a boyfriend and manages to fight for life. But recently, I got very disappointed in my sister and my grandma. Grandma never liked me and was never satisfied, even though i wasn't problematic and i tried to always please her. I paid all the bills in our house and tried so hard to be the perfect person. Until 3 weeks ago when she finally told me she thinks I'm no good (and a lot of other ugly stuff). So naturally I moved out and everything was pretty alright until last night. To give you all more insight into my situation, I am almost 25, a healthy female (aside from my anemia which I'm fighting with and hence the headaches and heart palpitations before sleep), I'm employed, although I am currently lonely at my new place and had great plans for my future. Like taking up a new course, getting a job i like, a coworker even jnvited me to gym so i will go with her and hopefully gain a friend in this city cuz she seems cool af. Also i started journaling, every day i name stuff I'm grateful for (sometimes they even make me cry). But... losing mom when i was 12, losing dad when i was 15, witnessing abuse and being abused daily until dad was gone, being bullied at school, never having a romantic relationship, being forgotten by my friends, being left out because I'm easy to forget, being taken lightly because i am always available, being disappointed by my sister using her mental state to emotionally manipulate me into always feeling bad, grandma always calling me a failure for working a minimum wage job and dropping out of uni, grandma wanting me to be someone i could never be, me rn at my new place being scared of how those 2 women will react when they see where i live now... nevermind all that because i was genuinely happy and excited every day until last night and that's why I'm so scared. scared that these are more than anemia headaches (because i have them every night since December and sometimes even during the day), scared that i will be given anxiety pills and they will mess me up and scared that i will keep feeling like this. what can any of you tell me, do you have any advice or comforting words? i will go to a neurologist tomorrow to check my head and i will resume my therapy sessions in 10 days. until then I've been given some pills to help me fall asleep, because the way i was scared last night and couldn't sleep+that horrible headache, totally made me feel bad almost the entire day today. i feel restless inside my chest, i feel anxious and everything is so scary.",1,0,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jbad01/anxiety_feeling_hopeless_and_scared/,last night horrible headache went er got even worse scary thoughts attacked thoughts like ill always pain ill always alone theres one could come rn tell ok etc etc sister problems last year institutionalized months shes still struggling meds shes working boyfriend manages fight life recently got disappointed sister grandma grandma never liked never satisfied even though wasnt problematic tried always please paid bills house tried hard perfect person weeks ago finally told thinks im good lot ugly stuff naturally moved everything pretty alright last night give insight situation almost healthy female aside anemia im fighting hence headaches heart palpitations sleep im employed although currently lonely new place great plans future like taking new course getting job like coworker even jnvited gym go hopefully gain friend city cuz seems cool af also started journaling every day name stuff im grateful sometimes even make cry losing mom losing dad witnessing abuse abused daily dad gone bullied school never romantic relationship forgotten friends left im easy forget taken lightly always available disappointed sister using mental state emotionally manipulate always feeling bad grandma always calling failure working minimum wage job dropping uni grandma wanting someone could never rn new place scared women react see live nevermind genuinely happy excited every day last night thats im scared scared anemia headaches every night since december sometimes even day scared given anxiety pills mess scared keep feeling like tell advice comforting words go neurologist tomorrow check head resume therapy sessions days ive given pills help fall asleep way scared last night couldnt sleepthat horrible headache totally made feel bad almost entire day today feel restless inside chest feel anxious everything scary
1jba3wy,1741975106.0,Facing complex mental health issues,"I'll try to summarize everything clearly.

I have an autoimmune problem that caused me to suffer from tonsillitis (strep) and pneumonia in childhood.

I started taking an antihistamine and these problems subsided (disappeared) (I never had pneumonia again and tonsillitis occurs very, very rarely now (maybe 1 or even none in 5 years). I bumped my head many times in childhood, and only had my head X-rayed in every case, without any other kind of intervention or scanning.

I've always had a kind of physical “tics” starting from my childhood to the present day.

I've always had attention problems and have been described by people as “absent-minded” or distracted.

Until then I've always had fairly mild OCD symptoms and emotional lability (getting emotional for no apparent reason and watery eyes, as if I'm about to cry).

I started using hashish from the age of 19 to 22 (for 3 years) and at around the age of 20 I started to notice problems: increased attention difficulties, a severe reduction in short-term memory (I don't know what I'm going to do next and I get lost in chains of thoughts), OCD symptoms became moderate/severe, which is one of my main concerns.

I also feel a disconnection between myself, my understanding and words (something I didn't feel before hashish). It sometimes feels like I'm not quite here or present. I've started to have difficulties or obsessive thoughts about interpreting sentences. For example, I know the meaning of all the words in sentences, but it's difficult to put together the overall “picture” of the sentence to make sense of it. I started to have difficulties with words like “before” and “after” in more complex sentences. I also developed great difficulty in organizing my speech and lost the ability to improvise conversations.

I haven't consumed hashish for two months, which means I no longer have cannabinoids in my system, but I still suffer from the consequences and fear I'll never get back to normal.

My life has started to become a mess. Sometimes I can't even tell if an event really happened in reality or if it was a dream (as I've been having trauma-related dreams almost every night lately), and I'm left wondering in uncertainty. What do you think could be happening to me? I'm currently taking escitalopram (SSRI) and Xanax XR (benzo).

I know that diagnostics should be carried out with a health professional. I currently have a psychiatrist and a therapist (I'm doing cognitive behavioral therapy), but the appointments are very short. I'd like to know if any of you have or have had a similar experience. Even though it's not exactly a mental problem or disorder, I keep wondering why I have to take an antihistamine every day so that I don't get itchy (especially in the scalp, shoulders, joints, thighs).

This is a really complex problem that could have come from a number of different things.

I would be very grateful for any response or sharing of your experiences. 

Thank you all for your time and for reading

1jb97xq,1741972785.0,I feel trapped,"I feel like I'm not living my life to the fullest. Lately I've been full of stress and sadness about what I'm experiencing and I'm living it in a pretty negative way, even though I'm a very positive person and always try to look on the bright side of things.



I've been working in my current job for about 3 years. It's not a very complicated or difficult job but there are times when it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety. I'm pretty indifferent to it but I'd like to do something more challenging and creative and I'm afraid of being stuck here for a long time.



I have no social life and no friends. I have a good relationship with my parents, then there is nothing else. I chat with my colleagues at work but it stops there, I go to play volleyball twice a week but I can't make any friends there either. I am a very curious person with many interests but even if I find someone who has the same interests as me I can't fully connect, as if there was something blocking me. When I was little I was able to make many friends, but as I grow older I can't anymore. I'm not good at chit-chatting, when someone tries to talk to me I completely freeze and I have a hard time continuing the conversation. To people I seem like a snob.

  
I think I'm an ambitious person and I would like to do something creative as a job maybe cartoonist, illustrator, photographer. Recently however I feel down and even though I've been drawing for a long time I feel like I'm not at a good point, that I'm wasting time and that I'm not good enough to undertake this career.

Maybe it's just a bad period, but I just want to be at least a little proud of myself. Connect with other people, love someone and try to live a life that is at least satisfying for me.

- Now what are 2 things you can smell? Fresh air, air freshener, perfume…

- Then, what is 1 thing you can taste? Could be aftertaste of a drink or if you have something you can taste in front of you, do it.

The intention of this exercise is to get you out of your head & connect with the environment around you. People sometimes feel a little less on edge after doing this.

At the beginning I was hesitant now that it was my fist ever job and to start with such a demanding job just didn't go well with me and I knew I was gonna have problems working there overall, but I still gave it a chance. I know how hard I worked at my job and I know for a fact how much effort I was putting on each of the tasks I was given, I really started having a hard time with my supervisor who just for some reason he texted my stepdad where he said I was lazy and barely working and calling me things like a ""baby"" and words like ""lol"" which threw me off, I was putting so much effort every day and for him to just talk like that about me just kinda pissed me of. My family don't believe me they where just telling me to work harder and that if he was saying those stuff maybe I was slaking off and that pissed me off even more like my own family didn't believe I was working hard. Anyway I'm just gonna shorten this, I had trouble with my supervisors wife who had a job there because of pure privileges and even lied to my step dad later saying it was a joke, my coworker did drugs on work and I kept quiet and then unti this Monday where I got called by
my boss not my supervisor, to tell me he has given me many chances (he never even once's gave me any chances let alone even sat down with him one on one this was the first time) then he let me go aka I got fired, I was out of words cause one of his statements was that my coworker were saying I wasn't working when I WAS and let me not leave out that none of my coworkers put effort working they only worked when my supervisor was around and they did drugs right there while working. Now I have to wake up with my stepdad putting a two ton stare on me and that stresses out, it's not my damn fault that I got ""released"" because of some bullshit I was so embarrassed that I just couldn't see my mom and siblings to the eyes because of the embarrassment I felt, I have no idea what to do anymore and I honestly just want to disappear but I'm gonna keep going.

I feel like I'm almost loosing my sane. I don't know how to explain, like I can’t control myself and Im not a union of personality. I talk with myself throught a few different characters and each of them are the part of me but still it's not me.
I feel hopeless and frustrated one day and the next day I want to change everything in my life so I feel so overwhelmed that I can't to start anything. I often need at least an hour to fall asleep because I can't stop the thoughts in my head (they could be full of energy of full of despair). But for the most time it's something like i dont feel any bright emotions but again I still can expirience positive things so I'm not such hopeless, right :'D
I always have a thought in my mind that it'd be better to not exist but I'm used to this and don't really pay attention. I think in our time when the world is collapsing is such a common thing.
During puberty I explained everything as ""teenager hormones"" but my puberty ended a long time ago and I still feel like a shit most of the time.

I've asked to online mental health resources about some issues but they don't seem ready to listen to you (which is understandable cause they're free so I don't blame them). And when conversation turns to something more serious like suicidal thoughts they immediately redirect you to other resources even thought I DON'T have that much crisis.

I'm trying to not diagnose myself but I have a tradition checking my symptoms with online tests (I know I'm hypochondriac). I have emotional and feelings changes every day. I'm so confused and scared of myself that I can't determine which mood I have at any moment.

I can't talk about myself in real life and anything negative inside me I pour out onto others in aggressive and toxic way so I struggle with interpersonal relationships. Moreover, I can't even socialize cause I feel unconfident and scared of being in places with more than two people.

I don’t know, maybe I'm overthinking again but I live in this stage of uncertainties for a few years. Just some symptoms turns to others and it became harder to control. (I guess. IM NOT SURE IN ANYTHING)

1jb74ul,1741967550.0,"Help guis, I feel lost totally","Hello, I am twenty five years old. A dude whos pretty lost in life, everything bad spirals around. I have issues with mental health from what I can see I suppose, but I am still in some sorta denial because I feel like its just life and I am all mellow and soft to digest things life throws at me. So basically I started smoking weed pretty early-on, around the first year of high school (15 y/o), it happened occasionally here and there, but with time it progressively got worse, long story short I was smoking at beginning period of occasional puffs and tuffs like once or twice a week, my best friend whom I am no longer in good relations anymore since he is still associated with that life was a dealer, he grew day by day as a dealer and I simply didnt like that life so I backed off and we basically cut all ties. We’ve also lived a certain period of life out of our country, independently, we abused cannabis also heavily during that time of our lives, to cut down the story abit again eventually it led to all other common and known friends since I’ve taken that life as is, everyone pretty much fell out to worse addictions, either MDMA, cocaine, ecstasy and stuff like that. I was always intensely radical about never consuming drugs that contain some sort of intense chemical compounds which interfere with your brain structure from heavy usage. There were all sorts of sightings, for me personally, I come from a smaller town/village, however you wanna call it and I’ve spent some time living in big cities, all together I lived in bigger cities for like maybe three years, I saw pretty much the dark side of addiction and what it kinda does to people, I dont judge anyone since everyone has their own problems but from my standpoint I was always a pretty chill and nice dude who just wanted to hang out and have fun, but I kinda ended up in such surrounding, which led to heavy cannabis consumption, all “friends” I knew pretty much rooted around that life, we all kinda gravitated to such influence, I mean I probably got to it since I was always a huge fan of hip-hop, but what I am trying to say is that with time I just kinda felt this wasnt my place, I am not like a typical fiend, bad willed dude who kinda wants to be cool and think only about money, I just ended up in that scenery by destiny, I dont know, still cant kinda decipher it. So to get to the struggles of today, so basically nowadays I just feel off, I’ve quit smoking, but in period from twenty to now I still kinda relapsed and came back to this lifestyle (only smoking pot, keep in mind). I’ve been sober now for like a year almost regarding weed, I still drink alcohol here and there but I kinda refrain from that too because my psyche just feels off. The issue is I feel mentally unable to comprehend things, I feel like nowadays I feel more dull and inactive mentally, I cant really read between lines when I speak with people, only if its like a direct and honest reply or a conversation, w/e, I feel incredibly out of touch with people in dialogues, I just feel like I have nothing to contribute, to add to the convo to spice up the atmosphere, I cant make no jokes, I cant feel relaxed in a public/group setting. I never feel like I want to fit in, its just in general hard for me to socialize since I am like extremely critical of myself or whatnot.

1jb4zh5,1741961940.0,Is it better to speak or to die?,"Kinda cringe title, but it’s a genuine thing I (F16) have been thinking about. I do not have a good relationship with my mother (F43) and she is the main cause of mental health issues. I can’t fully blame her as my whole entire life has been traumatic. I’ve suppressed so much that I only remember pieces of my life in glimpses and my first memory is being sexually assaulted for the first time out of the three times it happened. As if that was my first time gaining consciousness despite being 7-8 years old.

My mother promised therapy when I eventually came out and told her about this, but never followed through. I’ve always noticed her doing more for my siblings than myself, but it’s been showing a lot more since we moved to Florida in May 2024. She got married to a woman she was dating for 7 months and moved us all down here. I’ve made it clear from the second she told me about the move that I didn’t want it because I knew I was mentally unstable and being so close to people who were not her (such as my friends and boyfriend m16), helped me a lot. But she did and now I feel like I have no one.

She has put a lock on our fridge, our mudroom, put a camera in the kitchen, she has not given me a proper lock for my bedroom despite buying a new one for herself and me telling her that because of my assault trauma, i don’t feel safe without a proper door lock and that my family likes to just enter my room, also giving me 0 privacy. i cannot do laundry without asking her, i cannot eat without asking her, and i have no distractions. I’ve had two jobs before, but I can’t find one, and even if I tried, it had to be somewhere that she would want me to work and it couldn’t be far because she complained about having to pick me, her 16 year old daughter, up but happily drives her adult wife to work every day. 

She has neglected to get my braces and glasses changed in two years, I asked her to put me on birth control three years ago, and nothing came of it. I asked for therapy three years ago, nothing came of it. I text her constantly about my mental state and she either won’t respond or express how much of a burden I am and how unhappy I make HER when she is the main source of my unhappiness. 

My boyfriend offered up his place for me to move into when this year is over so I can get my mental health together, start working again, start brith control, get therapy, and get away from my mom, and despite me telling her that me moving back home is mostly because of my mental health and my future, she doesn’t care. She tends to use the fact that I’m under 18 to her any advantage and hasn’t once tried to understand that I’m not well.

I’ve been trying to convince her but with every time she says no, I feel myself physically realize that I might be stuck with her for another year and that is what is making me feel like I need to take my life. I have never felt more hopeless in my life and I know I can’t go like this. She’s so obsessed with keeping me as her daughter when she is well aware that she is pushing me closer to the edge. She refuses to listen to anything mental health related, she refuses to take me to the doctor or dentist, she’s openly called me a burden. 

I’ve decided that my last way out of this will to contact DCF and ask to be removed from my home for more reasons than I’ve listed here. I won’t be sparing a single detail. If this goes nowhere and I speak, yell, cry, and shout just to be left with her, i will lose my last reason to live.

No one seems to like the things I do irl (Go-karting, indoor rock climbing, just a chill fast food hangout too, claiming it's expensive altho its not that much), unless it's related to alcohol or something horrible like that (I don't drink alcohol btw).

And on top of that, many of my friends are just busy with their personal lives, and struggle to make time too. Or they're just way too far away, so meeting them becomes a chore at that point (Since I live in a city, the traffic is just atrocious). I don't know what I'm doing, I am doing an internship, go to the gym, tried everything...Still I seem to feel ignored even tho I don't think people feel that way. At church I tried this too, but idk....I feel like I'm unheard, it's like I'm quiet and relaxed outside, but I'm depressed af inside but I don't want people to know and end up being a burden to them. God, I wish I wasn't forced by my parents to study all the time throughout middle school and high school instead of hanging out with my friends or doing something outside :( I'm just a mess inside lol. Can't even get good sleep anymore

If I did say people that I'm going thru all this loneliness, they'd care. But I don't wanna use them like that, and want them to genuinely wanna hang out and not do it just cause it's something I want from them.",6,2,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1javq1a/just_feeling_so_lonely_yet_surrounded_by_people/,im even kiddingthats life rn year old guy literally friends care abt none irl friends r online different countries altogether care abt im lonely irl one seems like things irl gokarting indoor rock climbing chill fast food hangout claiming expensive altho much unless related alcohol something horrible like dont drink alcohol btw top many friends busy personal lives struggle make time theyre way far away meeting becomes chore point since live city traffic atrocious dont know im internship go gym tried everythingstill seem feel ignored even tho dont think people feel way church tried idki feel like im unheard like im quiet relaxed outside im depressed af inside dont want people know end burden god wish wasnt forced parents study time throughout middle school high school instead hanging friends something outside im mess inside lol cant even get good sleep anymore say people im going thru loneliness theyd care dont wan na use like want genuinely wan na hang cause something want

I suffer from depression and anxiety. I’ve been working hard for years to improve my mental health. I’m seeking help. I’m on meds, but nothing REALLY helps. I’ve been working minimum wage jobs forever. I went to university for film which I no longer want to pursuit. So now I have debt and a worthless piece of paper. Every other opportunity I go for that could get my out of this rut never works out. My father has alzheimer’s but he lives 5000 miles away. My grandmother just passed away. It feels like it’s always one bad thing after another. I live with my mom with no hope to get out. I’ve never felt like I fit in this world. I feel so alien and such an outsider. I can’t connect with people on a deep level either. Everyone is just an acquaintance to me. I’m social, and outgoing. I can converse with people no problem. But it’s always very surface level. I don’t feel like i belong here. I’m not made for this world or this life… I’m just so lost and hopeful about my life and future.

1jb0a09,1741946016.0,Im losing friends all of a sudden and I don’t know why.,"Im a 1st year college student enrolled in a pre med program whos been diagnosed with depression and OCD since 2021. Usually my biggest fears were people hating on me or friends ignoring me, and I usually have that gut feeling that it had something to do with a “me” problem. What frustrates me most is that I really cant tell what I did wrong if I ever did do something.

Recently I have been facing a lot of problems (academically, socially, and family) that made me feel like I have reached my bottom pit again. I dont have the energy to clean, cook, and do anything except play video games (my usual escape). I can also tell that my mental health has been affecting my academics which makes everything more worse honestly.

I havent had therapy and checkups in 3 years, not because im done with it, but because my family stopped taking me to it. This is where things get worse, I mean at first it was fine but then negatively progressed when I found out my mom cheated on my dad several times in their marriage life, and she told us days AFTER my HS Grad. So that really messed me up badly again. Yk that feeling when you fele like smth is wrong with you or you have symptoms of disorders but you dont wanna diagnose yourself? Well im not gonna self diagnose of course but I have noticed that I have symptoms of ADHD, I observed it for a year already and I wanna get checkups again so that I can properly know if I have it or not but I think that is what is affecting me majority these days.

My attention span is fucked up, and my friends have called me out for this whenever we chit chat. Its very noticeable when I study too, I really cant focus straight anymore. Idk if this is related but I tend to be direct in what I feel and say because I really cant find the right words and I really wanna stop this but idk its so hard to stop it. I feel like this is whats affecting my relationship with peers these days. Maybe they think im too direct? Or are there other stuff that I really can't notice or tell?

Im so sorry if this is so confusing, I literally have no idea in composing and organizing my thoughts. I was wondering if anyone could help me or could share their opinion about this? I dont wanna lose more friends and I wanna have positive relationships with the people around me, but I really think mental health is affecting it.",2,13,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jb0a09/im_losing_friends_all_of_a_sudden_and_i_dont_know/,im st year college student enrolled pre med program whos diagnosed depression ocd since usually biggest fears people hating friends ignoring usually gut feeling something problem frustrates really cant tell wrong ever something recently facing lot problems academically socially family made feel like reached bottom pit dont energy clean cook anything except play video games usual escape also tell mental health affecting academics makes everything worse honestly havent therapy checkups years im done family stopped taking things get worse mean first fine negatively progressed found mom cheated dad several times marriage life told us days hs grad really messed badly yk feeling fele like smth wrong symptoms disorders dont wan na diagnose well im gon na self diagnose course noticed symptoms adhd observed year already wan na get checkups properly know think affecting majority days attention span fucked friends called whenever chit chat noticeable study really cant focus straight anymore idk related tend direct feel say really cant find right words really wan na stop idk hard stop feel like whats affecting relationship peers days maybe think im direct stuff really cant notice tell im sorry confusing literally idea composing organizing thoughts wondering anyone could help could share opinion dont wan na lose friends wan na positive relationships people around really think mental health affecting
1jb3w8h,1741958880.0,I feel extremely pathetic for getting depressed over a online freindship,"I have turned 18 yesterday and i git the beautiful message that my bsf (whom i have a huge crush on) does not want to talk to me anymore 
I dont know what happened in the 21 days she was away from internet 
She usually deletes her account 
Also i should mention this was an online friendship 

I will try to fit in as much info as a i can 
I dont wanna return to any of this 
Its soo painful 
It made me have extreame suicidal thoughts 
Its also feels pathetic to be this attached to someone LITERALLY ONLINE 




I met her more than a year ago in November 2023 
We both quickly became good freinds 
Until the freindship broke once in August 2024 
She said i was manipulative and she didnt feel respected in the freindship which i wont contradict cuz my behavior was like that 
She did not give me any warnings before it hinting anything like this and i had to persure her to even know all this cuz she was like 
Do it on your own
After 2 weeks she approched me thru spotify changing the playlist description and all of that 
I felt like it was great efforts thats why i wanted to go back in the friendship and we did 
She opened up after a few months 
I FELT like we grew closer 
My crush on her was before the 1st break of friendship 

Now????
It was all normal after my jee attempt 
And it was all fine and good
I used to ask her about my behavior if it was bothering her in any way if so she can call me out 
I ASKED HER TO CALL ME OUT IF SHE FEELS LIKE IT MANY 
MANY TIMES 
I asked if my dm spamming habit is fine with her she said she doesnt mind it much 


But now? 
Literally the day of my brithday she told someone else to tell me she wont be talking to me anymore 
Got to know due to she knew i had a crush in her and she jsut wanted to be friends 
I never ever said to her i want to be in a relationship or confessed 
Whenever she wont reply to any specific dm of mine i wont repeat it as far as i can remember 
I rarely flirted with her 
HECK DUDE SHE HERSELF SAID ITS GOOD I AM NOT LIKE OTHERS GUYS WHO STRAIGHT UP DO IT WHEN THEY SEE A GIRL 
i never planned on comfessing to her 
I was scared 
Very deeply scared i will lose her 
But it happened any way 
I lost her regardless of my efforts 
Due to some reason i am not even sure is right 






I approched her as a friend 
As a person i knew who would talk to me and reciprocate the same energy  
God knows why she took this step again 

I am not gonna go back in the friendship even if she approches me right now which is very very unlikely 

Not my first time getting this heartbroken 
Before this was a girl but she was a huge red flag and i was the one ignoring all of that she i think it was obvious this will happen 


But this? 
I did not expect it
It makes no sense to me 


Ive lost my grandparents and my sister when she was young in the span of 4-5 years 

I can hardly take isolation anymore 
Its eating me up from inside 
She and i matched a lot 
And soo soo much that it was amazing

I have got a internship and a full time job offer in my hometown itself. Although the money is not that much but thinking about how the job market has been these past months , I was happy. 
The people in my office are very nice, I am getting a lot to learn. My family is also very happy since I am staying in the home itself instead of going outside. 
Recently I heard about a batchmate who recently got a job offer 10x more than mine. I am very happy for him. But somehow I feel that I am getting stuck in my life. In week days I am in the office for about 8-9 hrs including travel. Although I enjoy that time time due to good colleagues, but I feel I might get too attached with people around me and since this place lacks opportunities. Nowadays I feel my mind is not how it should be. Somedays I feel very happy, somedays I feel angry and somedays depressed. My friend whom I talk about all these will also leave for another town due to job. 
Since I am an introvert and very self conscious, I find it hard to share my feelings.
I want to ask men and women above my age, HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN LIFE?
HOW DO YOU KEEP YOURSELVES HAPPY AND MOTIVATED AND NOT AS IF YOU ARE LACKING?

1jb3jzh,1741957863.0,Want to burn myself again.(Bad at expressing myself hope you will get whatever I tried to convey),"Back in 2020, I was living my life just as a normal guy, suddenly thought hit me harder that I have wasted many opportunities and constantly hurt people around me, by the ending of 2020 I left everything everyone, and started burning by forearms. It felt heavenly. Till I felt sensation in wound, I felt free and relaxed but once it ended I wanted more n more burns, so in total I got approximately 30 burm Marks on my both forearms.
Then randomly I met a girl. Completely stranger, we were talking for hours and after 1 year of knowing each other we both committed to eachother. I was too much way serious about her. I left everything and started hustling for family and for her, I introduced her to my parents with clear intention that I'm gonna marry her only, after 3 years (December 2023) I got to know that she is cheating on me. It broke me apart. I was just begging and finding my fault, where did I lack ,
I never raised my voice never blocked her never said bye, never talked to other girls still blaming myself what should I do. I cried on my knees holding her hands don't go. I was begging but she left me. 
Practicality of my family was that I have to move on, financial debt, siblings' future responsibility ect.
So I started trying multiple ways by which I can keep myself busy, like
Running 10 to 15 km everyday 
Exercise 
Reading 
Study sitting for 10 to 13 hours a day
Nothing worked for me. I skipped my Company Secratary executive attempt(June 2024). Sought medical help as nothing worked for me. I was getting breakdown frequently. Shaky hands, frustration in legs, for   4 months I was on medication. But as I can't let go this upcoming dec2024 attempt, I leave my medication as I was feeling good but couldn't study with meds, in September 2024 I joined library, I say for preparation for 300+ hours. Then continuous medical emergency in family i could study, apparantly I failed. Now it's been more than 1 year, 2 month and handful of hours, I still feels the same pain. I just want to burn myself or just simply want me to be dead. I don't know what should I do. I don't want that person in my life. If she comes I won't allow her again in my life, I don't have any fake or false hope that one day she will come to me but but but it is hurting, everyday every second missing my love, feeling of to be loved as a partner. I joined training this January by which I can make myself busy but, tears come out anytime anywhere, in metro in office. Again those shakky hands sobbing in washroom alone crying rn too much to hold altogether. I just want to be calm to live again. I don't have any grudges or curse for her.
I love my family trying really hard for them for me, but a voice ""kashyap"" (she used to call me) hits me frequently and it turns my hours day in hell. I feel if I burn myself I can live life atleast till that burn mark will make my mind realise that something is causing pain n sensation.

1jb3a6n,1741957060.0,I went to therapy after 6 months and feel conflicted.,"So I called a counsellor after 6 months w/o therapy and I feel motivated. 

I’ve been super depressed for the last few months due to a traumatic family event and couldn’t bear the shame. I’ve been sleeping late and distracting myself with social media and video games. And so today I went on a walk and decided to call a counsellor. 

Let me tell you, it feels amazing taking these little steps, which the first step is addressing the depression and understand where the damage is coming from. 

Although motivated… it’s a bitter sweet moment because my boyfriend is partially the cause of my declining mental health. My relationship with him has been on flight mode for the last maybe 3 yrs together, we’re simply cruising by, not bettering ourselves. 

I can live in ignorance and live our mundane lives, OR I can strive for more but that would mean to… perhaps leave the relationship. We’ve been together for 5 yrs and we are both depressed. I can tell he’s depressed. He hates his job (he works for his dad. overworked and underpaid.) life is hard

[5 MINS LATER] I’m literally overreacting. I told my friend everything (via text) and just realised I should be happy with my life. I’m where I’m meant to be in life, at this very second. I’m proud of myself and my boyfriend because we’re taking baby steps.❤️ I highly recommend daily affirmations.",1,0,/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jb3a6n/i_went_to_therapy_after_6_months_and_feel/,called counsellor months wo therapy feel motivated ive super depressed last months due traumatic family event couldnt bear shame ive sleeping late distracting social media video games today went walk decided call counsellor let tell feels amazing taking little steps first step addressing depression understand damage coming although motivated bitter sweet moment boyfriend partially cause declining mental health relationship flight mode last maybe yrs together simply cruising bettering live ignorance live mundane lives strive would mean perhaps leave relationship weve together yrs depressed tell hes depressed hates job works dad overworked underpaid life hard mins later im literally overreacting told friend everything via text realised happy life im im meant life second im proud boyfriend taking baby steps highly recommend daily affirmations

doqwow,1572360722.0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2361,177,/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually leads either disappointment disaster usually works quite differently say pm anytime casual social context huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling hard work behind scenes information resources make easier give get quality help small start new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comments least youve gotten know someone maintained rdepressionwikiprivatecontact full text current version summary anyone acting helper invites accepts private contact ie pms chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intentions bad judgement either way unwise trust pm anytime seems like kind generous offer might perfectly wellmeaning unless solid rapport established wise idea points consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive replies publicly youll help people op responses good quality youll educate inspire helpers rule applies much anywhere else internet people struggling serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably low tolerance disappointment highlevel everchanging emotional need unless helper able make commitment every way long necessary offering personal inbox resource likely harm good mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give names callers arent allowed request specific responders much healthier safer callers develop relationship agency whole analogously much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole even trained responders generally allowed work highintensity situations alone partly availability mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper gets head someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality often comorbid depression escalate pm conversation much harder others including rdepression rsuicidewatch moderators help contrary common assumptions moderators cant see police pms observation many years people say pm consistently ones least understanding mentalhealth issues mentalhealth support gaps knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitations theres reason someone whos truly help would want hide responses community scrutiny helpers concerned privacy keep mind selfdisclosure used supportively feelings details problem use altthrowaway accounts restrictions account age karma know internet used people exploit abuse others people want hide deceptive manipulative responses everyone except victims many specifically target vulnerable mentalhealth issues helper invites op talk privately gives good supportive experience theyve primed person vulnerable abusers sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someones state mentalhealth crisis people rely heuristics critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might best option although dont recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectations realistic careful look history anyone offers pm opening

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",36,251,/r/depression/comments/1frqlk0/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/,welcome rdepressions checkin post place take moment share going accomplishment want talk shouldnt standalone posts sub violate role model rule permitted tough time prefer make post place share subreddit rules located sidebar also always access since exist important safety reasons ask everyone read follow please click report harmful content see always want know deal soon also several wikis help finding giving support provides guidance isnt depressive disorder guidance complex nature illnesses usually grouped depression label redirect information common offtopic issues offers information nature value peer support mentalhealth issues general lots guidance learning isnt usually helpful giving peer support ysk types rule violations frequently see interfering people getting safe relevant support people breaking private contact rule never trust anyone tries get private conversation response post see im help posts shows dont understand basic principles peer support especially selectivity giving help wiki explains role modelling ie achievement advice posts expertfree zone thats peer support means rule know internet culture celebrate bragging achievements bragging good intentions nothing like ever acceptable content thats making statement casually polling sub seeking personal support comment giving rules offtopic posts difficult situations circumstances including interpersonal losses grief sadness anger difficult emotions mental illnesses depression wiki suggestions places post issues valid serious inappropriate

1jbpv4s,1742023916.0,I'm in depression. No clue how to get out of it,"26M shy and introverted indian. Due to this, I've been alone and single my whole life. Couldn't even talk to any girl during my school and college lives. As a result of no female connection, got hooked up to PORN and MASTERBUTION. And now addicted to it for almost 15 years. Recently tried to get out of loneliness and comfort zone by confessing to a girl that I had crush on for about 8-9 months, went out for a month and had the best time of my life! However when I was about to have sex with her, the time I was waiting for my whole life, I just couldn't maintain the erection. Now I'm questioning myself whether I'll be ever to have it in future. And recently she broke up with me for stupid reasons when I needed her the most. Completely heartbroken. 

Apart from this, I'm the only bread earner in my family, so there is extra pressure. But now there are financial problems happening due to which there are frequent fights between my parents which makes me feel worthless that it's all happening because of me. Had I been more successful, this would not be happening.

I've lost interest in almost every thing. Not able to focus at all on my work. Many colleagues have started noticing these symptoms in office. And there is decline in productivity.

Due to above issues, whenever I'm extremely sad and feel lonely, I resort to PORN and MASTERBUTION for a minute of good feeling but feel horrible about myself minute after, that what person I've become. Listening to sad and depressing music, watching triggering videos, suicidal thoughts have become weekly routine. Stuck in this vicious cycle.

1jbuojo,1742043919.0,Forever alone,"Back in 2014, I was attending LSC-Kingwood for an AAS in Video Game Programming( not my choice.) There, in an elective course, I met a beautiful woman named Aly. She was a cool, logical individual with a scrumptious ass. Aly was majoring in occupational therapy and we hit it off in class. She’d look at me during lectures and I would look back at her, both romantically and sexually. We sat together in one-on-one assignments and group tasks. I’ve wanted to ask her out, but she prioritized her major first before romantic relationships. In our final exam, she created a question about me, in a teasing manner. Even after the class ended, Aly would greet me when seen on campus and I enjoyed every minute of it. From the bottom of my heart, I knew she was the one for me because she accepted me for who I was and I thought we could get married in the future. However, I changed my major, and the person who was advising me forced me to head to Lamar University. I was speechless, as my soul has been sucked like a vacuum cleaner. I never confessed my feelings as long-distance relationships typically don’t last long. For the last 10 years, I’ve never managed to get a woman’s attention, and regret not telling Aly the truth. Unless Aly comes back into my life, then I’ll never be in a romantic relationship. Being deprived of true happiness is the greatest despair anyone can face.

1jbugx1,1742043243.0,I Miss My Old Life and I Want to Cry,"I was just looking at some old pictures. Pictures from my late teens, like when I was 17. And I really miss my old life.

Back then my life was hardly ideal, to be clear. I was still struggling with depression and anxiety, though to a much lesser degree than now. As well as body dysmorphia. But beyond that my actual life was leagues and bounds better.

I had friends. I was young. I had just graduated high school and was going to a great college. I had a girlfriend I loved. My parents were financially secure. I was healthy and on top of that in good shape. I was never a social butterfly or anything, but I was at times going out or doing other fun things. I was working pretty actively on my writing with the hope of eventually publishing a novel. I lived in a stable, safe, democratic and prosperous country.

Now everything is different.

I have no friends. I'm maybe not quite ""old"" but I am much older. I had to quit college and have been unemployed for a long time now, with no real prospects of changing that. I don't have a girlfriend anymore, I've been single for over a year, and I feel desperately unable to find one. My parents' financial security is not what it once was either. I'm still healthy for now, thank God, but I am no longer in great shape. I'm not obese or anything, but I'm not in good shape anymore either. I haven't gone out and done something fun in about a year and a half. My mental health issues feel like they make it impossible to write. And it feels like the world these days is so much more unstable than it used to be.

I was struggling back when I was 17 with issues. But at the same time, I did have some feeling that there was hope as well. That maybe I could struggle through everything.

Nowadays though... I don't feel that anymore. Not only do I feel depressed, but completely hopeless. Like my chance to live a good life is gone.

I want to cry, but I won't. Because I suck at that too.",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jbugx1/i_miss_my_old_life_and_i_want_to_cry/,looking old pictures pictures late teens like really miss old life back life hardly ideal clear still struggling depression anxiety though much lesser degree well body dysmorphia beyond actual life leagues bounds better friends young graduated high school going great college girlfriend loved parents financially secure healthy top good shape never social butterfly anything times going fun things working pretty actively writing hope eventually publishing novel lived stable safe democratic prosperous country everything different friends im maybe quite old much older quit college unemployed long time real prospects changing dont girlfriend anymore ive single year feel desperately unable find one parents financial security either im still healthy thank god longer great shape im obese anything im good shape anymore either havent gone done something fun year half mental health issues feel like make impossible write feels like world days much unstable used struggling back issues time feeling hope well maybe could struggle everything nowadays though dont feel anymore feel depressed completely hopeless like chance live good life gone want cry wont suck
1jbkix8,1742003821.0,Depression Sucks,"I’m 57m.  I think I have had anxiety and some depression almost all my life.  I think I abused alcohol because of that, more on that, later. A couple of years ago, right after Covid, my depression hit rock bottom.  It was crippling.  It’s probably what they call clinical depression.  

Until then, I had not considered any meds.  But this time was different, I would wake up around 2:00 am every night and it would feel so gloomy.  I also was working out every single day just to stay alive and yet my depression would catch up with me.  Two hours of working out got me about 10 hours of stability.  Anyways things got worse and my workout remedy was less and less effective.  So I got on an antidepressant (Zoloft).  Onboarding was pretty rough, about 6 weeks of hell. I have been on it for a year, depression is mostly gone, I still get small bouts of it which I’m okay with. Also, my life long anxiety seems to have gone away.

Meds are tricky.  I’m okay I guess, I’m very productive these days at work.  Actually I have become a workaholic, which is not good.  Because I have no lingering depression, I feel good and haven’t been to the gym in almost a year.  All my muscles I worked hard for are mostly gone.   So there’s this motivation thing I’m still struggling with.  I don’t think Zoloft is for me, but I’m putting up with it for a while.  After all it did end my depression.

So my friends, I feel depression can be treated. It takes a bit of tweaking, the meds and dosage.  Talking to my doctor was the best thing I did. 

Also, I tried drinking recently but I don’t seem to be able to go past 3 beers.  Remember I used to be a serious alcoholic in the past.  I don’t want to say I’m now a social drinker or anything.  I’m simply done with alcohol.  I’m sure now my alcoholism had to do with my depression.

Life goes on. In the past I would say, what’s the point of all this? In the end we’re all going to die. Why bother? Today, I’m too busy to get these thoughts.  In the past when I woke up, I’d say “here we go again!”.   

Nowadays, I’m usually very eager to wake up and to my stuff - work, hobbies, etc.. There’s endless things to do, it’s a big world,  a bit convoluted, somewhat complex, but it’s a livable world.  It’s okay to be happy, excited even! 
Good luck on your journey!

1jbjo4g,1742001157.0,I’m everyone’s friend but no one is my friend,"Female 24, I have multiple friends that consist of 1 year of knowing them to 8 years of knowing them. I have multiple “friend groups” yet I feel alone. I have my main group of friends and we have been friends for about 7-8 years. It is 6 of us and Lately I have not talked to them or seen them. I tried talking to them and it seems like they don’t answer. I know they love and care for me but I feel like we are not friends anymore. My best friend seems to talk to me when she needs something. I feel like I am also so blame since they have invited me to go out or go to the gym but due to my depression, I say yes at first but then cancel the last minute. This is due to the insecurity and being the “duff friend” of the group. I miss them so much but it seems akward when I’m around them. And they get along with each other pretty well. My next friend group are my ex coworkers from my previous job, realistically it is just one girl and I love her to death we get alone pretty well and I consider her my closest best friend. I usually call her when I need help with my panick attacks and we just click. She still works at the previous job and talks to all of our co workers there. I know the people she hangs out a lot at work and lately they have gone out a lot and at first they invited but again I would say yes then cancel this is due to my son  and mom making me feel bad. I always want to make plans with her to go on vacation and she keeps saying that she needs to save up for a car but then mentions that her other friends want to go on vacation and she is going. It seems like she makes them a priority and I don’t mind but it makes me feel alone. Last “friend” group is my current job. I currently work for CPS and I have coworkers in my unit. At first it was fine but now it seems like they see me as the dumb co workers. They make fun of me a lot and make me feel dumb. This would include my supervisor we see each other as a “family” so we play with each other a lot. I do believe that I would be very playful but I now feel like it’s gotten to far. It does not help that main reason for my depression is this job. I feel like everyone in that job thinks I’m weird and dumb. I am super loud and I feel like everyone thinks  I am too dumb to do this job. Overall I feel like each one of the groups I am in my life have each other and in each group I am just there.   I feel like I’m the ugly friend because within all these groups they are all pretty and social and I am the opposite of that. At the end I feel like I am just the floater and I don’t have someone, I feel lost and alone.

1jbpq69,1742023285.0,"loss after loss, and I'm responsible for it","i dont know if any of this makes sense. its late, i can barely think. 



I threw away a relationship that was the best one I've had in a long time. it is only now, 1 year later, where i'm being honest with myself about why it happened. im not perfect, i dont claim to be. but im now learning that i was severely immature. i hate that I learn these things so late in life. I did try to be better when she asked. but for some reason these changes didn't click into my brain. i couldn't change who i was in those moments. i dont know. it's hard to explain.



i look back at some of our conflicts, where i would be so defensive instead of just listening to what my ex had to say. i have no idea why i was the way that i was. i look back and dont even recognize that version of myself. im 28 but it's as if i had the brain of a 12 year old back then. my maturity, understanding, everything was just so lacking. 



i know i caused hurt, and pain, and so many other bad things. yes my ex was not perfect either but she was better than me. her lack of understanding during my issues was miles better than me just simply not even being open to changing. 



when i'd get defensive, i guess i just wanted to avoid those hard but important converstions so badly. so i'd say stuff like ""why is this even an issue?"" even though it clearly was important to my ex. 



I lost my ex and my mom in a very short time span. life hasn't improved in a year. for a year, i stayed delusional, making up reasons why im not some awful guy that deserves to get dumped, but now i know, that I am. that's what hurts more than anything. i remember my ex telling me that her family and friends are all really disappointed with me. in the moment it made me angry but i see why now. 



I've thrown away relationship after relationship. and most likely other aspects of my life too. im probably so messed up right now but i wont realize it for another few years. am i just some underdeveloped child pretending to be an adult? i hate the pain I've caused others and i have an incredibly difficult time forgiving myself for any of it either. im not here to make excuses. im disappointed in myself. im not a good person. 



in about an 8 month span, i had so many losses in my life. friend's suicide, job loss, parents accident that killed my mom, dad's health issues from the accident. life since then hasn't gotten better much. this week, I've looked back at that chapter in my life and thought about the losses that i did have control over. and now i know that i may have kept myrelationship intact if i wasn't so immature. because of me, i lost her too. 



depressed doesn't even do any of this any justice. Throwing away this relationship, and even the one before it, i just feel so disappointed man. i hate the whole 'oh you'll learn as you go' thing. all my friends have forever partners right now. and they 'learned' the things i learned way back. but my stupid incapable brain just sabatoges everything. 



im definitely still not perfect. my gut tells me that if i find someone, some stuff will happen, i'll be dumped, and it'll take years for me to figure out that i made other stupid mistakes. 



I've been through difficult chapters in life before but this is the absolute worst. it's hard to live through. knowing im responsible for some of it makes me REALLY not want to be around. this week, I've thought about killing myself daily. each day I've only inched closer. im just so sorry to everyone and everything I've completely ruined with my stupidity. im sure im not even a good son or brother or friend. i feel terrible.",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jbpq69/loss_after_loss_and_im_responsible_for_it/,dont know makes sense late barely think threw away relationship best one ive long time year later im honest happened im perfect dont claim im learning severely immature hate learn things late life try better asked reason changes didnt click brain couldnt change moments dont know hard explain look back conflicts would defensive instead listening ex say idea way look back dont even recognize version im brain year old back maturity understanding everything lacking know caused hurt pain many bad things yes ex perfect either better lack understanding issues miles better simply even open changing id get defensive guess wanted avoid hard important converstions badly id say stuff like even issue even though clearly important ex lost ex mom short time span life hasnt improved year year stayed delusional making reasons im awful guy deserves get dumped know thats hurts anything remember ex telling family friends really disappointed moment made angry see ive thrown away relationship relationship likely aspects life im probably messed right wont realize another years underdeveloped child pretending adult hate pain ive caused others incredibly difficult time forgiving either im make excuses im disappointed im good person month span many losses life friends suicide job loss parents accident killed mom dads health issues accident life since hasnt gotten better much week ive looked back chapter life thought losses control know may kept myrelationship intact wasnt immature lost depressed doesnt even justice throwing away relationship even one feel disappointed man hate whole oh youll learn go thing friends forever partners right learned things learned way back stupid incapable brain sabatoges everything im definitely still perfect gut tells find someone stuff happen ill dumped itll take years figure made stupid mistakes ive difficult chapters life absolute worst hard live knowing im responsible makes really want around week ive thought killing daily day ive inched closer im sorry everyone everything ive completely ruined stupidity im sure im even good son brother friend feel terrible

1jbov71,1742019506.0,Feeling Overwhelmed & Alone While Facing Big Medical Decisions,"
TW: Medical, Isolation

I’m really struggling with feeling isolated while dealing with some major health issues. I have Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) and very likely need a brain shunt to save my vision—my upcoming spinal tap will confirm it. On top of that, I also have Myasthenia Gravis (MG), which needs to be stabilized before I can even get the shunt. Because I have a contraindication to IVIG, that likely means long-term plasmapheresis (like dialysis, 2–4 hours per session) and a port to make the treatments possible.

These decisions feel completely overwhelming, and even though I know I have to be the one to make them, it feels like too much to carry alone.

I do have a supportive spouse, but they’re at their limit—stressed, overworked, and exhausted themselves. We don’t have any other family support, and despite trying to connect online, I still feel incredibly alone, hopeless, depressed just everything.

I know no one can make these choices for me, but I really need to connect with people who understand what it’s like to face high-stakes health challenges. 

How do you cope with the loneliness of carrying the weight of your health struggles alone? Have you found any online spaces that help with this kind of isolation?

I’m in therapy, but I’d love to hear from others who’ve been through something similar. Thanks for reading.

1jboewj,1742017641.0,How I’ve been feeling,"Hi , I just wanted to say sum things I need to get off my chest . First of all, I hope everyone is having a wonderful day,  you don’t really need to care or read the entire post , I’m just trying to help the most ppl possible and also trying to learn how to feel a little bit better being in my skin :)

Most importantly, sometimes I feel like I could be a burden or an outcast to my family, friends and my partner. The reason I might possibly feel this way is because the times I’m with them , they seem to not really care or acknowledge my presence . Btw  I’m the second oldest child of five , so I might not be acknowledge at all sometimes by my family. Don’t get me wrong no matter what I will always love and care for  my family, friends and partner; but I feel like they don’t really seem to care about me at all sometimes. I know that it seems a little far fetched on what I’m saying but it feels that way , well I feel that way. Mmmm well I am boring and a lil uninteresting , maybe that could be the reason why i feel that they seem not to care. Who knows it could be a lot of reasons why , but I don’t really care . I feel like it’s got to a point where I don’t really care , I feel like I could love  someone even though they don’t  love me back. 
 
I felt and been alone most of my life , doesn’t really mean that I would prefer to be alone but I think it’s better that I am . I’d had to learn a lot of things by myself and obviously I’d had done some mistakes but I think it’s a lot better to learn by yourself. I’m not  saying that everyone has to learn by themselves but it’s better and it feels good when you do learn something new yk ,when you do it yourself. It’s nice to be alone sometimes , it’s relaxing and peaceful but it could really mess with someone mentally. For example, I was all alone for an entire summer break once, I knew I could spend it with my family or friends but I decided to be alone , I wasn’t really in a good mental state at that time so I just really wanted to be alone . It felt nice being alone at the beginning of the break, it was relaxing cuz I was finally taking a break from school , but when I started to see my friends on social media posting themselves hanging out with each other, it got to me.
I think I got worse mentally , I started overthinking , my anxiety got worse , I felt back into depression. I think I had depression previously but it really  didn’t feel as bad as this time, I really started to think about ending myself . The whole break was like a nightmare , sometimes i used to feel like I wasn’t real. I don’t know how to explain it but sometimes I’d realize what was my purpose in this world , imagining a world without me , how would I family be without me. I really thought I was going insane , some a moment I forgot how to interact with ppl . For those wondering, I lived with my father at the time , my brother used to live with us  but he moved in with my mother. My brother used to always argue with my father, it just disappointed me cuz we didn’t really go out all together. For context, there was a time when i lived with my father for a while , at the time my brother was deported to Mexico along with my mother. Long story short,  I didn’t see them  for a really long time, the rest of my siblings  and I are US citizens so we could go see them when we wanted to .  I did see them in 2020 during lockdown , a year after they got deported, it was so happy seeing them again. After that, my father told me that he too misses my brother , so he decided we will go see them again next year but this time we will live there. I was shocked when he told me but at the same time happy . Btw my parents are divorced, and the rest of my siblings are actually half-siblings . I’m so sorry for going off track here😅, mmm where was I.  Oh yea, when we got  here I was happy we were going to together again but I dad realized my brother changed he was older from the last time he saw him. 
My father didn’t like this version of my brother , I was sad but I couldn’t do anything, I felt bad when he moved out . I always thought he didn’t really like to be around us so I just accepted it , he told me he was tired of my dad. 

Umm I think I’m going too much off track , might edit sum stuff out. To be honest, this might be a dumb idea of a post.

P.S.   This part of the post is 4 months later from since I started writing this.
Some things changed since then, I think I’m getting sick; I might be getting worse .
I don’t know why I feeling this way again, I feel like I’m trying to hard to fit in with people. I’m was considering moving out after finishing school, I don’t know where yet but I really need to leave. I’ve been overthinking again , I don’t know what’s wrong with me; I feel like I fuck everything up. I don’t know why but my dad is being such asshole to me. Probably it’s just me realizing he’s always been this way, this is probably how my brother felt . 
I haven’t been eating well nor sleeping well either, this might be my all time low. Those “thoughts” haven’t cross my mind yet if you know what I mean. 
Before I post this I want everyone to be that you actually have no one but yourself , take care .

1jbns9f,1742015140.0,I feel so stupid,"Hey guys. I'm sure this is common but that doesn't make it hurt less. I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder btw. Now, to my story. I was madly in love and in a very serious relationship with a woman for over a year. We truly did love each other. But, one day, she decided that the relationship wasn't going the way she wanted it to be, and that we we're too different. And so, she dumped me, without even sitting me down for a talk first.

We stayed in contact after this and eventually a few weeks later, we met up again. We both expressed how we still did love each other but the only problem was she wanted some time to be single, so we agreed that I'd wait for her to be ready for a relationship again. But sadly, this became unhealthy for us and ended relatively quickly. 

After this, she wanted no contact because she wanted to just move on with her life. I didn't, because, well, I still loved her. And so, against her wishes, I went to her place with gifts on valentines day. She was not happy, but wasn't rude. She made me go home though. 

Fastforward a little, now I am blocked from everywhere cause I can't stop talking to her online. All of this happening got me depressed since december now, when we broke up. My psychiatrist even ordered for me to calm down on medication for the month. It's been bad, and I need help. Not only for my depression but also for just moving on. Because a big part of me knows I must move on. But part of me also does not want to, in hopes of her coming back. 

It's stupid, I know. But I'm not in school anymore and my job doesn't have any coworkers, so she truly was all I had besides my family. My friends are also busy with their lives, so I've felt so lonely and dejected. 

Please leave some advice for me.",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jbns9f/i_feel_so_stupid/,hey guys im sure common doesnt make hurt less diagnosed anxiety disorder btw story madly love serious relationship woman year truly love one day decided relationship wasnt going way wanted different dumped without even sitting talk first stayed contact eventually weeks later met expressed still love problem wanted time single agreed id wait ready relationship sadly became unhealthy us ended relatively quickly wanted contact wanted move life didnt well still loved wishes went place gifts valentines day happy wasnt rude made go home though fastforward little blocked everywhere cause cant stop talking online happening got depressed since december broke psychiatrist even ordered calm medication month bad need help depression also moving big part knows must move part also want hopes coming back stupid know im school anymore job doesnt coworkers truly besides family friends also busy lives ive felt lonely dejected please leave advice

1jb83f2,1741969984.0,What if you can't save yourself?,"Tw: brief mention of suicide, no active plans or thoughts.


We all have heard this quote 1000 times: ""No one is coming to save you, you have to save yourself."" And what about the people who can't save themselves? Are we just lost causes? Collateral damage? Are we like those products who leave the factory faulty?

I am 36 years old and my whole life is just a struggle. I'm not exaggerating. I was psychologically abused since birth, told I was i useless, weak, could do nothing right. First by my dad and grandmother, later also at school. All my life I struggled with basic life stuff, chores, school, jobs, adult life. I tried to save myself all my life.
Everytime things got a tiny bit better, the next shit happened. I batteled alcoholism, eating disorders, undiagnosed adhd and trauma. Everytime when I got beaten down I got back up, kept fighting. But it was useless.
I again have no job, I still struggle with basic adulting, I can't pay my bills because my salary was so low. 

I know the quote is true, no one will save me, but I can't save myself. So now what? Because ending it is also not acceptable for people. And please don't tell me things get better or I can do it. No I can't. I tried, over and over and over and the ourcome was the same. All the struggle, just to fail again and again.
Yes I'm in therapy, yes I have meds, yes I exercise and all the other jazz. It didn't matter.
I'm completely exhausted in every way, drained, hopeless, done. Please don't be scared for me, I do NOT plan to end my life. But I give up fighting, trying, struggling, I have nothing left to give. I will just let life do whatever it will do.

I just needed to get that out, maybe someone can relate.",9,4,/r/depression/comments/1jb83f2/what_if_you_cant_save_yourself/,tw brief mention suicide active plans thoughts heard quote times one coming save save people cant save lost causes collateral damage like products leave factory faulty years old whole life struggle im exaggerating psychologically abused since birth told useless weak could nothing right first dad grandmother later also school life struggled basic life stuff chores school jobs adult life tried save life everytime things got tiny bit better next shit happened batteled alcoholism eating disorders undiagnosed adhd trauma everytime got beaten got back kept fighting useless job still struggle basic adulting cant pay bills salary low know quote true one save cant save ending also acceptable people please dont tell things get better cant tried ourcome struggle fail yes im therapy yes meds yes exercise jazz didnt matter im completely exhausted every way drained hopeless done please dont scared plan end life give fighting trying struggling nothing left give let life whatever needed get maybe someone relate
1jbmwuo,1742011937.0,I need help,"This is my first time ever even attempting at maybe getting peer advice on my current mental state. I’m a 23 year old male that’s currently a rural EMT, and I am as well in paramedic school, my problems start in my teen years with a drug addicted mom and a very stressed and angry home, while all being in extreme poverty. This made getting through school a complicated and hard process, and because of my situation I was bullied through a majority of my school career until 10th grade when I met a great group of friends and a girl that was the one maybe, she made life changing impacts on me, she gifted me clothes and fed me, she had done so much kindness towards me, that until this day I couldn’t accurately describe it, life went on and the family and financial struggles continued, I was able to land a clerk job after graduation then later a dry cook job that paid more, this girl I spoke of staying by my side throughout the duration, my father, one of the best men to ever live on this planet died in 2023 on a emergency room operating table from bleeding to death due to failure of proper balloon placement because of an active heart attack he was having, he let the heart attack carry on for too long so by the time he reached the hospital his arteries became easily tore every time a balloon was placed. That night I felt so worthless and while sobbing walking out of the hospital into the rainy night I swore from that night on I would do whatever possible to prevent further death or harm to people, that’s why I’m currently doing the job I’m doing, after he died in me and this girl moved into an apartment together, I was still a fry cook and was trying to figure out how to get into EMT school. As for the apartment we remodel it, her being a huge cat person, I adopted two beautiful cats, also during this time my mom became worse off on drugs because of dads death. This girl and mines relationship had its times of arguments since the highschool era, and they worsened because of me. I was projecting the emotions of my dads death on her and that wasn’t fair, things kept escalating to the point where one night I came home and it was early January of 2024 and she told me that she didn’t love me, that I didn’t make enough money and that she has been cheating on me with her coworker for months… I was absolutely devastated, she left and went to her mothers, things got ugly about certain property and we ended up in court with me winning what was mine but I had to leave the apartment since the lease wasn’t in my name, I was now homeless in a blizzard, very suicidal, which I have always dealt with that challenge in life, to make a long story short my brother saved me by letting me couch surf and use his place as an hq to get my EMT, until this day though I’m haunted by all the bad things that has happened to me, but also by all of the bad things that I have done, I have nightmares, it’s almost like her ghost won’t let go of me and I’m suffering, at the end of it all, I think that there were times I could have been more understanding and mature, more times that I could have listen rather than speak, I think we were two young people being out in the world for the first time and that and my dads death just overtook us, it all feels so unfair but life is unfair, I can’t really seek professional mental help as I fear for my job, because I love what I do and it’s in honor of my dad, I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live, my heart aches loudly for all that I have loss and I hope to maybe reunite with all that has fallen one day I hope, as for her and I that is for sure over and history, out of all of this I realized that we are all heroes in one person story but a villain in another’s, if you took the time to read this far thank you, I have had all of this on my chest for years ",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jbmwuo/i_need_help/,first time ever even attempting maybe getting peer advice current mental state im year old male thats currently rural emt well paramedic school problems start teen years drug addicted mom stressed angry home extreme poverty made getting school complicated hard process situation bullied majority school career th grade met great group friends girl one maybe made life changing impacts gifted clothes fed done much kindness towards day couldnt accurately describe life went family financial struggles continued able land clerk job graduation later dry cook job paid girl spoke staying side throughout duration father one best men ever live planet died emergency room operating table bleeding death due failure proper balloon placement active heart attack let heart attack carry long time reached hospital arteries became easily tore every time balloon placed night felt worthless sobbing walking hospital rainy night swore night would whatever possible prevent death harm people thats im currently job im died girl moved apartment together still fry cook trying figure get emt school apartment remodel huge cat person adopted two beautiful cats also time mom became worse drugs dads death girl mines relationship times arguments since highschool era worsened projecting emotions dads death wasnt fair things kept escalating point one night came home early january told didnt love didnt make enough money cheating coworker months absolutely devastated left went mothers things got ugly certain property ended court winning mine leave apartment since lease wasnt name homeless blizzard suicidal always dealt challenge life make long story short brother saved letting couch surf use place hq get emt day though im haunted bad things happened also bad things done nightmares almost like ghost wont let go im suffering end think times could understanding mature times could listen rather speak think two young people world first time dads death overtook us feels unfair life unfair cant really seek professional mental help fear job love honor dad dont want die dont want live heart aches loudly loss hope maybe reunite fallen one day hope sure history realized heroes one person story villain anothers took time read far thank chest years

1jbkmxd,1742004160.0,Depressive episode,"Every year starting from mid February to april i get the worst depressive episode to the point i can recognise it and just hang in there untill the time passes 
I've been on antidepressants for almost a year and it's good but i wanna let out what i feel right now
I don't wanna go to sleep and in the morning i don't wanna wake up, i just want to stay in bed doing nothing but I can't because i got uni projects and midterms in a couple of days and i need to get shit done
There's a lot of stuff i wanna do and search about and discover more in what I'm passionate about but i feel like i don't have the energy to do so. The week is long and each day is long. The weather smells like the days of covid 19 with the lockdown and stuff. That was the most depressing period of my life. I remember i started questioning if I've ever been truly happy or it was all acting, i really forgot what happiness is like and whether it was real or not. I remember crying in the shower because i was questioning if i love my nephew or not. Everything lost its meaning back then and i lost connection with emotions other than feeling nothing, sad, like the world stopped, everyday felt like the other, i didn't know why would i wake up everyday is the same stale day. It felt like i was waiting indefinitely to be able to get out of the house. For life to get going. I felt like everything stopped and there was no reason to fight it, it wasn't like it would change anything anyway. I live with my parents but they weren't helping at all. I remember they used to tell eachother that they think they'll die soon. I really wanted to tell them shut up I'll be the one to die first. I remember i had some depersonalisation episodes ig? Wouldn't call it episodes but it was remarkable. Randomly i get the feeling that I don't know how i talk or walk i just do but couldn't comprehend how i did it. Idk if that's depersonalisation or dissociation idk what's called but it felt really weird.
Ig that's the first time i ever talk deeply about this period of my life mayde it's what started the seasonal depressive episode idk.

After dealing with depression for a whole decade (I'm 18 F) I've just gotten so tired of it... it was manageable when I had less responsibilities but now everything is just piling up. I can't keep a job because I can't get out of bed in the morning, I can barely eat or drink anything and I just sleep and stay in bed all day. My family is getting increasingly tired of me.. 

I'm a failure.. I don't think I can ever recover. Of course it's not just depression, I have a couple more mental illnesses I live with like BPD and some others that I feel like are a little irrelevant in this subreddit. I just can't find the point of living anymore, not even the love I have for my friends have kept me wanting to stay alive.. 

As per the rules I don't wanna delve too deep into it but after a whole year of being clean from self harm I relapsed. I hate it, I hate how it's the only thing that keeps me distracted from the pain I constantly feel. I hate it so much, I know it's a terrible habit.. that's why I got help but it just doesn't ever leave my thoughts..

1jbjqy8,1742001405.0,I feel so hopeless,"I'm freshly in my late 20s and I have accomplished nothing of value.

My parents neglected me throughout my childhood, I didn't go to school, the doctor, the dentist. They didn't teach me basic things or help me get the things I'd need such as an ID, I still don't have one since I don't have school records to prove my identity. I can't get a job, or anything really, without an ID.

I didn't realize how bad my situation was until relatively recently and it sent me into a spiral of sorts. I find it hard to leave bed most days, to find anything worth doing, to feel like I'm not just a lost cause. I'm so tired all the time.

Everytime I feel optimistic about myself and my life and that I can and will figure it out, I try and research on the internet and inevitably see posts from people who basically say you're absolutely fucked if you don't have your life completely together by age 30 and it feels like I'm running out of time and I don't know what to do.

The thing is, I don't necessarily want to die. I just don't see any other option. I don't want to be a burden to my friends or anyone else, I feel like I can't even talk about this with them because I'm so scared they'll judge me and shame me and leave and I'll have absolutely no one.

1jalad2,1741896247.0,I wish killing yourself was acceptable,"It seems like all my life I’ve had to be in constant misery. Everyday for the last 13 years (I’m 19 btw) has been a constant nightmare. I’ve had to deal with my crazy ass family my entire life, which I am now currently estranged from. I’ve been abused mentally and physically for most of my life. I never got to have friends really because I moved schools like every 6 months (I’ve been to 14 different schools) I was bullied constantly, I am a black female and went to predominantly white schools for most of my life. I was always called ugly, fat, the n word and much more. My mother was an alcoholic for most of my life, and my father abandoned me at 3. 

My mom was hardly around during my teenage years. She stayed away from me with whatever boyfriend she could find and I lived with my grandparents. My grandparents just seemed like they were waiting to die, all my life I’ve never saw them do much of anything even though they weren’t that old when I was younger (early fifties) I rarely even saw them kiss each other. I lived with my dad when I was 14 for a while but he had no interest in me really, he just wanted a nanny to take care of his wife and other children. My step mom hated me as well. 

Honestly a lot of bullshit in my life has happened and it feels like it’s mandatory for shit to just not work out for me. I saved up. bought my first car all on my own, no help from my family when I was 18, it got stolen 3 months later and no one helped. Haven’t had my own car since. Everyday I fantasize about killing myself, the only reason I don’t is because of my boyfriend and his family because they’ve really been trying to help me. But I genuinely don’t feel like doing anything with my life anymore, I never really did. I simply live for others now.

I just wish I could end it all without anyone caring, I just wish I could write myself out of existence entirely. I hate being alive and being reminded of how fucking abnormal my life is and how nobody cares. Everybody just wants me to shut up, work, and be happy. I don’t want to be anyone anymore

1jar1ot,1741911458.0,How do people function with depression and anxiety?,"I dont really have anyone to talk to about this so I’m posting this here. For reference, I am currently a senior in high school. Around 10th grade, my anxiety got really bad—I was battling panic attacks at least once a week. I wasn’t eating or sleeping enough I started losing motivation to go to school or interact with my peers. My absences quickly got really bad. I went from getting straight A’s to B’s and C’s. 

It got much worse in 11th grade and especially senior year. Most mornings I wake up and want nothing more than to rot in bed all day. I’m pretty positive I have depression on top of my anxiety and have tried to get help in the past but my doctors do nothing more than give me some links to online resources, which don’t work for me.

1jbikaq,1741997851.0,Feel so lonely even though I’m technically not,"I have a boyfriend and I’m not lonely in that sense, as we are best friends and I see him all the time but I have definitely grown apart from my actual friends over the past few years. I would say I have “functioning depression” at the moment, I have been a lot worse in the past but it doesn’t take away from the fact that a lot of the time I am depressed and extremely anxious.

I don’t really want to see friends anymore, I make no effort and I am now noticing I get no effort back which is 100% my fault. I say I don’t want to see friends yet I’m so jealous of people with really close friends. I‘ve always felt like a bit of an outsider, never been able to get really really close to people apart from when I was younger. I think it’s just anxiety that holds me back, I’m not relaxed or my true self. Every time I have social interactions even if they’re fine I am regretting it all and overthinking everything. It’s exhausting and I hate it. I’m so scared of any social interactions.

I don’t know what I’m looking for but I’m lost on what to do because I feel so lonely in a way but I also don’t want to see anyone. I feel so depressing and boring and just know that no one wants to hang about with me anyway, like they genuinely don’t. I don’t feel close to anyone apart from my boyfriend and I know I should be happy I have him and I definitely am but I feel lonely. Even when I talk to “friends” I feel like I’m hiding so much, they don’t know how depressed I am, they don’t know what’s going on in my life, they don’t know how anxious I am.

1jbgre5,1741992769.0,Reach out to that old friend.,"So I've had many bouts of depression, and I'm just surfacing from over a year long shit show. 

I have this friend I absolutely love, and he moved away right at the time I was having a major depression relapse. He sent me a happy birthday text well over a year ago and I didn't respond because I was deep in a depression spiral by then. I'm now medicated and have been doing a bit better for a few months, but the loss of this friendship has been weighing on me for a long time. 

I texted him today with a bit of an explanation, and told him I really missed him. He texted back and it's just like old days. Ive been crying all evening because I think in my head this guy hated me for never responding, but I've actually just got my friend back and he's just worried about me and wanting to make up for the last year+. 

I know this can't fix depression. I'm not fixed. But I missed this guy so much and now he's back in my life I feel a little bit of that hopeful excitement I haven't had for a long while. 

Depression wants to isolate us, and it wants to tell us our friends don't care. They do. They don't understand why we disappear on them, or why we act different, or why we're not interested in shared activities anymore. But they still care, and they will generally still react positively when we get back in touch with them after too long. 

If there's someone who was part of your support network you've lost touch with and miss... please get back in touch with them. If not for yourself, for them.

1jbgme6,1741992384.0,Struggling,"I’m struggling. I’m trying not to fall into a depressive episode. Life can change so quickly. I was in a good place. Good job, able to get a savings, caught up/ ahead on all bills, and just gave birth to my baby. Then the administration changed. I got laid off from my job, and now I don’t know what to do. I was in a remote position that was supposed to allow me to take maternity leave and then stay home with my baby until she’s older. If I needed help, I could have some one come to the house, but I’m still there to supervise. I have no desire to put my baby in day care especially at 4 weeks old.  Even when I looked into it, the cdc is no longer accepting kids due to the administration cutting their staff and budgets. The issue is my household can not afford our mortgage without me working. I don’t want to go back to work in office, but remote work seems hard to find currently. The thought of possibly having to be away from my baby is causing me to feel overwhelmed and sad. I have about 2 months before I will need to have a job. Hopefully, I can find something in that time. At this point, it doesn’t even have to be my normal salary. I’ll sacrifice the lifestyle I’m used to living if I can just get any remote role that will allow me to stay home and pay part of the mortgage. I’ve never felt this unsure about finding work.

1jbfjzu,1741989516.0,Burned out,"Well where do I start. 

For starters im 27m. I am currently a IT MGR (by title only) plus I do uber and side jobs just to survive (more on that later). I am currently single with a long history of heartbreaks one of which has been hurting for almost 3 years now. I am almost $100k in debt with a car that I am 20k upside down in plus multiple credit cards that have been charged off and I am just waiting to get hammered by debt collectors and or sued. All my hopes and dreams that I had growing up are completely and utterly destroyed by my own doing. I have my parents that count on me heavily and recently unloaded the house i grew up in on me despite my financial hole but could not decline either because of the great deal it is in my area. My job that I have held for 7 years 4 of which in my current role in IT has been draining me in every way from it having been a backwards promotion with 3 paycuts and possibly a 4th coming, I have had essentially every authority and respect that I had get stripped from me for no reason other than me being the guy that took care of everything and handled the issues that were headaches for others and despite all this I cannot leave this place out of fear of not being able to find a similar job in my area and my heavy loyalty to the GM/owner of my company. The only joy and relief I get comes from my for lack of better words 2nd family who helped me out years ago when I had issues at home and took me into their home where I regarded them as my best friends they are husband and wife plus their daughter became my goddaughter who without a doubt is one of the most precious beings I have in my life and has been the most consistent bright thing in my life for the last 5 years however she is entering her teenage era which as most of us know means that she is drifting apart from some of the people in her life which I can't even be upset at because its a part of growing up. (Sidenote as much as I love them they are very toxic and at times have made me feel very low but at the end of the day I still love them despite how rough the make me feel at times but the comfort and joy that I receive from them still outweighs that). I have really only 3 hobbies which are hiking with my dog whom I got a year ago to be my consistant hiking companion but because of all my financial issues I am hardly ever able to do so and he is also paying the consequences by being alone all day with me gone 14-16 hours a day. I also like shooting and road trips both of which I can hardly ever afford to do because again of financial issues and time constraints. In short I am running on empty with no bright light or happy ending in sight. My solution to everything for the last year has been just work and grind harder which i'm at the point where I have hit that limit. Most days I feel so exhausted that I can barely get out of bed and once I do I just dread the day regardless of what day of the week it is. The other part of it is yes I have severe depression which is only encouraged by my daily reminders that it is what it is and seeing everyone around me do and get better plus I am very much against going to therapy I have nothing against for those that do it but I will not. I am also very lonely romantically and have had one after another of failed relationships or situation ships for the last 3 years all kicked off by me getting the mother of all heartbreaks by a woman who I thought was the great angel that ever lived and treated me like the greatest man that ever lived with not a single red flag in sight. After she left I was a complete and utter mess that was beyond broken and hurt and took me months to dig myself out of that hole which once I did kicked off a whole bunch of these other issues. So now here I am just struggling to keep moving with no end goal in sight. At this point I can honestly admit that the only reason I am still breathing is because of the fear of what pain this would cause my mother and father and my other loved ones so to make it clear I am not a danger to myself or anyone else for that matter but as far as any reasons or goals for myself to stick around for there are none at this time and I don't see any coming anytime soon. So yeah this was my brief reddit rant about all this shit. I could go into far more detail but at this time I don't see any reason to maybe down the line I might clarify more.

1jb1ya1,1741952638.0,I wish I cease to exist,"I’ve (M35) a lot of childhood trauma that I truthfully don’t think I ever processed properly. I was SAbused as a child, neglected for a good part of life, and went undiagnosed with a variety of neurodivergence. 

Counsellors and psychologist don’t help because I choke on my words whenever I try to express my emotions. I couldn’t articulate anything to anyone about how I feel properly except for anger. I spent a good part of my life bouncing from one thing to another and never discovering my own potential.

I started working at 14 ever since my father passed away and pure neglect from my mother. I fell so sick from stress and the working conditions and I always remember the number of times I cried and beg my mother as I was closed to dying to send me to the hospital and she just told me it wasn’t her business. I had to be on anti-depressants to control the physical manifestation of what’s killing me at the age of 15 without knowing that I was taking anti-depressants.

When my mother died, I didn’t shed a tear for her because I remember her saying she will never regret what she did to me on live television when she was interviewed for her severe hoarding behaviour.

The lack of support had resulted in me failing school over and over again. Wasting 100,000s of dollars to get to where I am and seeking a diagnosis for cause of my problems. I have a stable job, I have an education after many years of trying but I feel incomplete. It is always setbacks after setbacks.

1jbdcfl,1741983742.0,Difficult times,"TW: Self-harm/suicide

For the past day and a half, I've been feeling like how I did before taking antidepressants; fucking terrible. Idk what happened - yesterday was good, nothing bad has happened to me this week, but here comes the pain train out of nowhere as soon as I got home yesterday.

 Frankly, I don't remember all that much. I remember playing Ghost Recon for a few hours listening to music, then got super exhausted and tired. I remember jerkin' it a little too hard, causing a minor friction burn. The most severe things I remember are the following: 

I browsed r/selfharm and r/selfharmscars. I don't know why I did, I've never even struggled with sh and I know that it's terrible, but I've noticed an urge to cut after visiting those subs. I visited them this morning too. I know it won't help, but there's an urge.

 Other thing I remember is being really thirsty, only having access to lemonade and sun drop, and i had the urge to relapse on soda. Lemonade has been fine for a couple weeks, but it's not good enough. I don't want to relapse on soda, but I'm not left with many other options.

On top of this, I've been dealing with stress and anxiety from college despite being a high school senior. I want (I think) to become a psychologist - scratch that, I NEED to become a psychologist. That's my dream, I was promised that I can reach that dream, and its the main reason why I keep going. If I don't become a psychologist, I will die.

My OCD has gotten worse in the past couple of days; it took me 20 minutes to get in the shower because I was fulfilling compulsions. I'm never the type to seek reassurance, but I have been doing that in an unexpected way; making sure my grammar is perfect. It's not as bad in a Reddit post, but half of my time in English yesterday was spent looking up ""when to use commas vs semicolons"" or ""do you quote paraphrases"", and i know that you don't but i can't stop making sure, damnit!

The anxiety portion of OCD has manifested as political anxiety; there's a terrorist in the white house. It's gotten betterish, but it does still impact my life. I'd go further into detail on that, but the last time I did that I got a warning, so.

I've been abusing my Vyvanse lately, I'm embarrassed to admit. 30mg daily, took 150mg on Monday and yesterday. I just get so fucking bored at school cuz by the time the teacher says what to do, I've already done it. No cell service save a few hotspots (not allowed to have phones out in class anyway), only have one friend in one class, and Jetpunk is only entertaining for so long. I can't not do work, seldom am i entertained by doing anything but work. I often dread weekends, and Summer is awful. The more Vyvanse I have, the less bored I am, thus the less anxious I am.

Sorry for the long post, I'm going through the ""dump all of your problems onto Reddit"" stage. Not that I have many other options; no hobbies, very rarely hang out with friends after school, no therapist (college offers free therapy, so i feel bad going right now rather than be patient), I know that my parents will support me; but I'm not quite ready to ask them for help yet, and friends either dgaf or don't know how to help. 

It's looking bleak, folks. At this rate, life getting better vs it getting worse is a coin toss.",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jbdcfl/difficult_times/,tw selfharmsuicide past day half ive feeling like taking antidepressants fucking terrible idk happened yesterday good nothing bad happened week comes pain train nowhere soon got home yesterday frankly dont remember much remember playing ghost recon hours listening music got super exhausted tired remember jerkin little hard causing minor friction burn severe things remember following browsed rselfharm rselfharmscars dont know ive never even struggled sh know terrible ive noticed urge cut visiting subs visited morning know wont help theres urge thing remember really thirsty access lemonade sun drop urge relapse soda lemonade fine couple weeks good enough dont want relapse soda im left many options top ive dealing stress anxiety college despite high school senior want think become psychologist scratch need become psychologist thats dream promised reach dream main reason keep going dont become psychologist die ocd gotten worse past couple days took minutes get shower fulfilling compulsions im never type seek reassurance unexpected way making sure grammar perfect bad reddit post half time english yesterday spent looking use commas vs semicolons quote paraphrases know dont cant stop making sure damnit anxiety portion ocd manifested political anxiety theres terrorist white house gotten betterish still impact life id go detail last time got warning ive abusing vyvanse lately im embarrassed admit mg daily took mg monday yesterday get fucking bored school cuz time teacher says ive already done cell service save hotspots allowed phones class anyway one friend one class jetpunk entertaining long cant work seldom entertained anything work often dread weekends summer awful vyvanse less bored thus less anxious sorry long post im going dump problems onto reddit stage many options hobbies rarely hang friends school therapist college offers free therapy feel bad going right rather patient know parents support im quite ready ask help yet friends either dgaf dont know help looking bleak folks rate life getting better vs getting worse coin toss
1jbcs6v,1741982333.0,How do i not lose myself?,"Soon 18, actually have a good life. Lots of friends or peiple that like me, good family great living conditions but so fucking lost in everything i do. One week i want to die or just be unalive, but the very next one im the happiest man alive. Not goin to therapy, not on any meds, dealing with it by myself. Even though i actually have friends or just family that i can talk to about it, but the problem is i don’t want them to start feeling sad or bad because of me. I don’t want them to worry about me. 

The biggest proglem i have is not actually being i guess bipolar (of course i have self diagnosed it), but that i always need to wait for „it will be better”. I fucking know that, I really do, but i just cannot wait for it to be actually better. For the past 3 years i also wsnted to do shit, by shit i mean draw, learn piano, just be able to learn something but (i think its that) my ADHD just doesn’t let me. After literally 30 minutes i just cannot do anything I just get bored even when its the most fun thing i have done in my life. It gets me so pissed that i just get angry at myself and the very next time i just give up before i even start doing „shit”. And no i im sure its not because i „brainrotted my mind” by tiktok or just „have small atention span”, because i had this issue forever. 


Another problem is i want to end it all but i cannot because i dont want to see all these peiple being sad seeing me dead. And i truly believe that „it will be better” but i cannot wsit. I want it right now or just now when it will happen. Entire life is just been waiting waiting and waiting not even for the „itw will be better” but for wverything i have been just waiting. Also i have been changing my life mindset to „why would i do anything if i will die eventually?” which also really fucking helps me. 


I know that i have lived so little years but if my life will be like that for the next god knows how many i just can’t. 
the reason behind why im writing about it is to see if someone can relate or just maybe been through this whole shit and can give an advice how to actually start doing shit, or just be happy and don’t thing about killing myself wntire time? I don’t even know. Maybe im just writing to just get my feelings of to random strangers. I genually don’t know.

1jbcidx,1741981623.0,i think it's starting again after almost a year,"I think it's coming back and I'm scared. I've never been diagnosed with depression so I don't call it that way, but I've had symthoms that really point in this direction (sleeping a lot, being deprived of energy, gaining some weight, self-harming, suicidal thoughts/ideation, etc).

So for almost a year I've been more than okay. Like I was living life all over again. I didn't think it was possible, I was depressed for such a long time I really forgot that enjoying life is possible. Even on the sad, tiring and frustrating days I didn't have any suicidal thoughts or SH urges, which is such an accomplishment.

But the bad days are coming back. I recently had two instances where for around 24-30 hours I was feeling like the bad times are back. It scared me. I don't know what I did before that caused me to get better. Literally no idea.

I decided to drink less energy drinks, take a break from smoking ciggarets and watch TikTok significantly less. I need to try before it's too late. I hope I will be okay, I really don't want this state to come back. But at the same time the feeling of not caring, having this sleepy mind and light weight on my chest is kinda comforting, in a messed up way ofc cos I enjoyed life this year.

I guess I would like to read some advice from you guys. Especially from people who thought depression was behind them for quite a long time and then it came back. How did you manage it? Any advice is welcome tbh.

Take care <3

1jbcct6,1741981235.0,I know you feel it too.,"Me, Right now. Just empty. No longer have interest in everything. Relationship, work, money.
I don't know what happened. I just shot down myself. Stayed indoors along with my pets. Watching hidden jem movies or highly recommended films. I have no other family members to talk to.
I visited a couple of friends and never really told anything what's going on with my life.
Telling yourself not to bother them. They do have their own life and struggles as I do. The feeling of losing connection with people.
Questioning about the reality.
I tried reading good books and aswell listening to some audiobooks.
I am feeling drifting away. Hobbies become boring. Is this adulting? I'm 25 and still so much life to live. Or is this loneliness? a phase where nothing feels significant. 
First time posting here. Yapping to strangers out here. But sometimes paste it to chatgpt or some ai chat, and it helps a lot making conversations. 
I know I need a routine to fix my physical and mental health, but how can I get up when my body and mind dont want to?

The challenge now is: what do you do with this awareness? Do you let it consume you, or do you find a way to move forward with it?

Peace.

I used to be depressed around 2 years ago and i was about to attempt it and even made my notes but the ringing of the church bell got me like awake while I was at the edge of the terrace. After some months i was starting go get better ig and even got a gf and she became my reasons of living, I looked forward each day because of her but she broke up with me saying i guilt trip her and stuff. I never meant to do it and still don't know what she meant by me guilt tripping her coz she was my everything.she said that her being the reason for me living was too much and stuff. After that i just couldn't even feel emotions, i didn't feel happy sad angry , i just felt empty. I wanted to die, like i wasn't able to do it but wished smth will happen that'll kill me. After some months, ig my emotions also came back , i could feel it.

At day time I'm all good, with my friends and others, i enjoy their companies and it feels peaceful or fun but when i get home and night in my bed when I'm alone , i get the overwhelming sensation of something is not right in my life, i wish I never existed. My appetite has gone as have been losing weight and i also feel like I'm just acting to get attention by saying i feel like killing myself. It feels like I'm faking things like of killing myself and depression coz I want attention. But I've never talked about my mental health to anyone. Ik I have friends who'll listen to me and love me to death and will do anything for me and I love them too but i also have never told it to them coz i just can't say it or feel like I'm attention seeking, i wished they asked me, ik i would burst out crying if someone asked me geniunely if I'm ok but again i still don't know what i have or I am gaslighting myself to believe I'm depressed or smth.

I've been feeling really overwhelmed and isolated lately. I've been struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of inadequacy, and I'm not sure how to cope. I've tried talking to friends and family, but I feel like I'm burdening them with my problems.

I feel like I just annoy people around me even if they tell me they aren't, I can see the disappointed faces of my parents everytime I see them even though they try to hide it behind fake smiles.

I also have had suicidal thoughts recently but I know i won't go through with it because I don't want my parents to blame themselves for not knowing what I am/was going through.

The only time these feelings ,these thoughts vanish from my mind, the only time I feel like I am free is when I am riding.

1jb8uef,1741971866.0,Still feel horrible after 2 months withdrawal,"Hi,

I was on Zoloft for 4-5 years for anxiety (which I’ve had my whole life) and depression that had gotten bad during that time. It really helped me. Though, it really decreased my libido and made me numb, and was sleeping a lot. I didn’t totally feel like myself. I tried tapering off it about 2 years ago but had immediate suicide ideation and was crying all day every day. So my therapist and psychiatrist put me back on it. I felt good again. 

About a year ago, I told my psych about my negative side effects. She also put me on Wellbutrin to weigh each other out. I liked it, but it wasn’t the perfect fix. After about a year we decided to try and taper off of just the Zoloft. I was only on a small dose of 25mg at the time (had been going down in dosage over the last couple of years when being on Wellbutrin as well and trying to help my side effects of Zoloft).

It’s been 2 months off the Zoloft and I feel my depression symptoms are only getting worse. My therapist thinks I just haven’t had to deal with emotions like this in a long time and I have to work on trying to handle them all over again. I do agree with her, but every day is a struggle. I cry most days, sometimes I’m flooding myself and am laying in bed crying over nothing. I feel very depressed and irritable and unhappy about everything. I sleep a lot. I’ve tried doing a lot of what I’m working on in therapy but it doesn’t seem like it’s going to stop this depression. I’m trying so hard to push through and wonder if it’ll just adjust in time but I don’t know… is this normal? Does anyone have any advice? I’m suffering and I just want to feel better.

1jaz2px,1741940472.0,sick of being suicidal and hating myself,"I’m so sick of trying so many different things to help myself, then just feeling worse off. I (23F) was diagnosed with ADHD last year after years of just being told it was anxiety and thought that would fix things, but whenever I’m low I just feel like I’d be better off ending it. I tried a few years ago and I feel like I have trauma from that and how terribly I was treated afterwards. 

I barely have a relationship with my family and live interstate from them, I have heaps of acquaintances and casual friends but no one I could speak to about this. I live with my partner (27F) and have mentioned some of this to her, but she just says the classics like you’re so valued and loved, and that it would hurt her too much, which honestly just makes me feel worse. She made me see the GP and I’m seeing a therapist so feels like she’s managed the situation, and I love her too much to tell her it’s not helping. 

I feel like no one takes how I’m feeling seriously because I still get up and go to work, exercise daily, meal prep and act like a fully functioning person. I have no option but to do this, if I stop working or actually take time off I just feel ten times worse because I’m out of routine, and then I spiral even more. 

I don’t know what to do anymore and I just needed to put this out there and not hold it in. If anyone has any advice or stories or anything please go for it, at this point I’m desperate because as much as I think I’d be better off not here, I do love my partner and don’t want to do that to her (and after my last attempt I’m terrified of trying something then not succeeding and ending up worse off again).

1jb3pjc,1741958334.0,Why do I feel so defeated and sad whenever I go out,"I don’t know what is wrong with me. Im 22 and yesterday I went out with a group of friends and we were clubbing and I had a date at 10 so I left my friends and went to the bar where my date was and I had previously known this girl and we clicked before so I thought this would go good and that she would probably crash over at my place. 

No idea why I made that assumption but I was so sure that she would come back to mine that I deep cleaned my room, bought a candle (because dorms smell lmao) and even left the little lamp on so when we come back the mood is set. I have no idea why I was so sure and cocky that she would come back with me but when she said she has to go back home because shes a commuter and its like a 2 hour public transit commute I just felt so sad like I fumbled the whole thing even tho she might have liked me but just couldn’t come back with me. 

I set up these expectations for myself and then end up disappointed when they don’t happen. After I hugged her goodbye I decided to go back to the club across the street my friends were still at, in the group of friends I went out with there is a girl I particularly like but other than a few times we hardly ever speak, I said months ago that her hair is the kind of hair that poets write poetry about and she brought it up like last week so she still remembers that but I almost never go up and talk to her and it just ruins my mood because I want too but shes such good friends with my other guy friends that she spends most of the night out speaking to them and being next to them and I just feel awkward trying to cut in the middle and jump in to the conversation. I really wanted to ask her to dance and despite us dancing right next to each other I just couldn’t muster the courage.

One of my friends I go out with is really taller (im six foot and hes like 6’4) and is a really good looking guy and he somehow manages to not do much and stand in the middle of the dance floor and somehow makeout with multiple girls a night. I try doing the same thing and it never works somehow, I don’t know why but that ruins my mood too even though the rest of the guys I went out with all go home alone despite trying to get laid but they have smiles on their faces and still enjoyed their night getting drunk but for me I just feel like a failure, its like I put this in my head before going out that I need to talk to a bunch of girls at the club and end up bringing one of them back home but when I do get there I almost never go up to girls and just dance in the group of my friends hoping a girl will come. 

Most of my friends went out last night and barely talked to any girls despite wanting too and went back home alone but they were happy and still had a good night but I went out clubbing and even went on a date with a really nice girl but somehow I feel like the biggest loser at the end of the night. 

it’s not like i’m really bad looking, i’ll be honest I have a decent face my main issue is that my nose has a deviated septum so my nose is asymmetrical as hell and I am very self conscious about that and it doesn’t help that I have jewish nose either but other than that I have good hair and can dress well and am six feet tall and in the past like the last time I approached a girl was during my reading break when I went to tokyo and despite not knowing the language I met and took a girl back to the hotel so it’s not like I have no hope left but I just feel like every night I go out and don’t approach women or try flirting is a night wasted. 

what is my issue and how do I switch this mentality.

He leads a completely normal life and even continues working; however, he is unable to remember certain events that happened a specific period of time ago.  
His short-term memory is completely normal—he can remember recent events and those that occurred up to 1 or 2 months ago. However, if you ask him about something prior to that time frame, he is unable to recall it, as if he had never experienced it.  
Additionally, his memory is also normal regarding events he lived through from childhood up until approximately 10 years ago.  

For the past 2 or 3 years, he has had Menière’s syndrome, but aside from that, he has no health issues or any other diagnosed condition.  

In terms of his personality, he has always been an extremely quiet and uncommunicative person. Lately, he has been saying that he feels quite nervous and depressed.  

His father had Alzheimer’s disease.  

He has visited a neurologist without success. A brain MRI showed completely normal results, and short-term memory tests also came back normal.

The inability to learn math, especially when one is intelligent and capable in other areas, becomes a wound that never fully heals, manifesting as:

    Professional limitations (I can’t pursue certain careers).
    Academic struggles (I feel permanently behind).
    Personal shame (Why am I so stupid?).
    Existential frustration (I’ll never be to learn this).

1jaz7gm,1741941071.0,How can I help my GF?,"My Girlfriend is in a deep hole and its not getting better. 
She is currently in training, but her workplace is very toxic and demanding. 
She cries when thinking about work, her family mostly doesn’t understand and her mom pressures her to go. She herself doesn’t want to quit, because she is just a few months away from finishing training, and if she does quit, she‘ll have wasted almost 3 years. 
I am working in IT, and told her to take her time, if she needs to, then quit, I can provide for us both. Not sure how, but I will manage.
She really wants to finish training tho, for her sake, and her mothers. She and her mother have a bit of a toxic relationship but she values her mother over everything.

Now comes the thing that is making me worry a lot: 
she started making up excuses to not go to work. She gets sick a lot, thats true, but she also started calling in sick when she wasn’t. I told her, to take a day off to collect herself now and then, her mom on the other hand tells her to go, because working is what people do. get over it and go to work. even if you are sick.
This went so far, that today, she started taking a hammer and hit her own foot, just so she got an excuse not to go.

I don’t know what to do and how to help. The issue lies way deeper than just her workplace. She is insecure over everything. She is in her 20s and when I met her, her mom had control over everything. I‘m trying to get her more autonomy, but its a slow process. I mean, for example her finances, I told her many times that it is not normal, that her mom keeps track of your banking at that age. At first she didn’t even have her own Debit card. Her mother was holding onto it. That is just one of many examples.

We have made slow progress by sometimes getting her to buy stuff on her own, or her saying our Order in a restaurant when we are out eating, just so she starts doing things herself.

We tried getting psychological help for her, but its not working out. every place is full, and is offering a waiting list.

1jb2dbt,1741954082.0,Rant and questions :/,"I remember telling myself as a 16 year old that by the time I turn 21 I'd kick the bucket. I'm 20 now, and I was really hoping by now life for me would get a lot better, but I'm afraid it's gotten not so great like I wanted. I've tried therapy and medication on and off when I was younger, I don’t really remember it helping me much. The medications were egh and therapists always told me thing I already told myself. I have a tough time trusting therapists because I feel like they don’t mean anything they say and they’re just talking until times up and you’re just cash to them (Sorry if you are one 😬) I’d like to give it a go again, maybe this time around it’ll mean something. Recently I've had this panic like feeling that I really need to get my shit together and getting medicated is the only starting point I can think of. I would also like to look into getting diagnosed with autism as I think I might have that, adulting is very fucking hard for me and I don't think it'll get any easier.

I also have anger issues and I'm really crashing heads with my parents so I know it's time for me to move out soon. This really adds to the pressure, I haven't the damnest clue how I'm going to be able to afford that. I think this might also link with my autism, I don't know how to work with it, and I don't want to tell my parents as I can already image how they'll laugh at me and say I'm ridiculous for thinking that but they’ll need to learn how to work with it, and me. I feel like it’ll just be way too late to start mentioning my autism but it’s now or never I guess. Don't get me wrong, they're good folks they just don't ever take me seriously. We've never 100% gotten along, for years we'd get into huge fights, my mom specifically, and at some point my parents will shut the door on me and that time is soon I feel. I'm not blaming them, I also think I need to fuck off.

For as long as I can remember, the thought of having to live life for a long time was the worst. Going through one week of life is so exhausting. I have to do it again for what, another 50-60 years? I know it sounds stupid, everyone else does so why can't I? I genuinely feel like there is absolutely nothing for me, like I was some error somewhere that wasn't actually supposed to be here so now I'm stuck belonging somewhere I wasn't supposed to. Just living life because I feel like I have to. I don't have a partner (still have to tell my folks I think I’m lesbian woohoo), friends, the only connection I have is the occasional conversations online and the small talk at work that's insignificant, and my parents. I also believe my autism works against me when it comes to socializing and I swear everyone sees that. I haven't had a friend in years and that never really bothered me. I'm naturally a quiet person but my mom keeps mentioning it which really rubs my wound, thanks mom I know I'm lonely lols.

I don't really have much going for me. I have an average job that makes me feel sore at night. I don't have many hobbies other than drawing but that's just a little activity that doesn't mean much. I don't have much I treasure either. Like I guess I can say my parents obviously, I love my folks but even now the feeling is just so bland. I used to be VERY passionate about caring for my animals (I looove my pets) but again, it's just so bland, So annoying, my pets and family. I sound like an asshole but that's just how I feel and I hate thinking that. All I can ever think, every day coming home from work is ""when will this be over"". Just about everyday I think to myself that I really want an off switch. Everyday is annoying, exhausting, and meaningless. The closest thing I have to peace is when I sleep but even then I'm awarded a gracious 6-7 hours. I usually sleep in till late afternoon on my days off which is the best thing life has to offer right now.

I didn't really want this to be a self pitying post, more like a view of how I see my life, (note I've been feeling this way since starting 15-ish?) but take it as you will.

Anyways, I guess the ""request personal support"" part is, how do I find value in time and just life in general? Or advice on how to stop making life feel like a chore? Can I even feel better after feeling this way for so long? I have to find some value in life, I mean I'm asking for help kind of so that has to mean that I do. Has anyone else felt this way but found more fuel to go on? Is it too late to find spark in life? How did you start adulting when you had no idea how to? How do you care for yourself as a new adult? If you're neurodivergent, how??? How do you live your life without being miserable? Does therapy really help And how was/is your experience with getting medicated and therapy? How are you doing with your depression? I'd also love to read some things that made you keep going.

1jagxq8,1741885475.0,Feel like my life stopped at 17,"I’m 24 now, going to be 25 this year.

I feel like my life stopped at 17. When I was 16 my dream was to join the British Army, therefore when I finished school, I enrolled into Military Academy at college. A few mates from my school also joined the same course, one of which was my best mate who I’ve known for about 12 years.

During my year at college, it was the greatest time of my life. Considering home life sucked as mother was an alcoholic and step dad was old and abusive, I loved college and I felt a sense of belonging. Everyone on our course got along and felt like brothers and sisters. We did weeks away together, doing real life exercises of what life was like in the military. I loved every minute of it. 

However it all came to an abrupt end when my mum decided she wanted to move house again, this time 2hrs away. I decided to get a job and rent my own place, so I did, but that meant leaving college and working full time. After a few months I applied for the army. I did the interviews, medical, fitness tests then it led onto army selection. I failed… I failed because I had a back injury which still affects me today. I was 17. This destroyed me. I didn’t know what to do. The only thing I found pure love in was my time at college which was preparing people for the forces. But to find out my mates were all successful, I kinda felt left behind.

Now, I’m not in contact with a single one of the people on my course, there was about 20 of us. I truly feel like my life just stopped there and then and since I’ve been depressed, with a mix of disappointment, loneliness, and dealing with home life. I feel like there’s just a void in my life that I can’t fill anymore and never will be able to. As I said my back still plays up, I’ve put weight on since as well due to being in so much pain after going for runs etc. I’ve had many sports massages and nothing has helped. 

I still remember college like it was yesterday, it was 8-9years ago now and even though now I’m in a steady decent job and live with my girlfriend of 7 years, I still would trade anything to go back to those days and do it all again.

1jawmm1,1741929735.0,How do I deal with this and is it actual depression?,"So I can't get diagnosed since my parents wouldn't allow it if that makes sense. Anyway my life is a living hell sometimes and I wanted to come here to ask if it's actual depression. If you have any clarifying questions, i'll try to answer them.

Looooonnnnnnggggg story short, I had a less than four month old puppy who died from an illness and her sister who had the same thing (didnt know either had it until death) died under two weeks later and I never got a proper goodbye. This was fifth grade. It sounds like I'm overreacting but I'm not kidding. I was a pretty smart kid who was happy and then I moved, new school, everything and then they died. I had no-one to talk to since we were just a few weeks in, I had just got glasses (already suuuupppppeeeerrrr insecure about getting them so my life wasn't the best) and proceeded to switch classes once they got some info transferred. I was home alone. Holding a knife to my chest after months of grief, stress, loneliness, insecurity, and just being numb. I broke down when my pups came in through the doggy door and the thought of them being alone broke me. In 6th grade I felt a bit better, not completely, but wounds were healing and I had one close friend who has supported me. In 7th grade, it all got so much worse. I had cut my wrists, made vent art as an outlet, and wanted to die so many times again. When a girl I had been really close friends with for years called me racist (we had a chat where she would put in another language and we all asked her to stop-mind you i was learning this language-and she blew up at me calling me racist) and our friendship was over after a long argument. So many little things made me resent her even more after that too. I started isolating myself from people after getting into more fights-everything is always my fault ig-and went back to being super suicidal. I almost cried in classes from everything bubbling up inside me, started not being hungry and (already having body issues and wasn't eating lunch) went over 24 hours without any food. I just wasn't hungry, SO tired, lost motivation, forgot about anything for myself, and all I could think about was the suicidal thoughts in my head and I really wanted to kms. The stress, loneliness, trust issues i developed, constantly blaming myself, that girl (told my best friend that I was toxic but my bff just knew it wasn't true) was backstabbing, I got body shamed (reference: 5'4 125 lbs worked out a LOT so it was mainly muscle) and grew even more shattered and insecure,  all led to a major decline in my mental health that I haven't recovered from and am still going through. Is this depression? My dad has it and his mom so it may be genetic? Idk. Either way I hate my life and just can't get out of this hole. My friend reported me for cuts on my wrists so the counselor and my parents know but nothing they try is helping. I can't take anti-depressants for a few reasons and my parents don't understand that i believe it's depression since they dont know about the suicidal part. How do i get out of this? At least make it better? Is it actually depression? I'm so confused.

I don’t want to go into graphic detail, but I first developed a complex around the age of 12 after I was sexually assaulted. That’s where the mood swings, obsession with my appearance, and growing fear of men. If I’m being entirely honest, it was probably nestled somewhere in my brain before than—considering that I was already living a dysfunctional home and was also sexually abused by my doctor, a man who I deeply trusted and was my pediatrician my entire childhood. I didn’t even realize he molested me until I was 17 years old, and that just made the depression worse.

I’ve always attracted older men, and it disgusts me. All men disgust me, really. Despite this I have resigned myself to a fate of being shackled down to an older man, if I get married at all, because it doesn’t make a difference to me. I’ll never be satisfied in life regardless of what happens, so why even fuss about anything? I don’t even want to get married, really, I just think I probably will because I always cave to societal pressure and I can’t help, but fawn around men. I hate that I can’t control it, but I either fawn or freeze in their presence because I don’t know how to interact with them, hence why I avoid them as much as possible. 

And I know I’m getting worse because I’m usually repulsed by the idea of sex. I’m always so grateful I’m still a virgin given the times I narrowly escaped being raped, but when I spiral I become much more sexual and I hate that because it feels so barbaric. I try to stay inside as much as possible during these times, because I know I will become overly compliant and easy…and the last thing I want to be is easy. 

Anyway, I hate the way I look—always have. I guess people find me attractive, I don’t get it though. All I see are flaws, and I try so hard to be different but nothing works. I hate everything and everyone. I fly off the handle over little things and spiral into rages. Nothing satisfies me, no matter what I achieve or who I’m around. I constantly have intrusive thoughts of hurting myself or others. I literally looked up mental institutions in my area because I feel like I should hospitalize myself before I get worse, but I know I would never actually get myself help. I can’t even hide it in pictures. I never smile and I always look upset or angry, even when I try to smile it shows. 

I feel like a monster no matter how hard I try, a disgusting pestilence. Sometimes, I just want to release myself from the prison that is my body and be done with it all, but I don’t want to disappoint my family. I wonder if it’s genetic, because people in my family have struggled with depression, addiction, and suicide as well.

1jaygvw,1741937790.0,Life looks meaningless,"I will get straight to the point, in the past (2 years ago) I finished highschool and I had wierd tendencies, like having multiple girl friends && I was watching porn from 9th grade. So, talked to a lot of women and all of my attention during all of my relationship was sex in the short term. I got into 3 short term relationships, most of are haunting me to this day. I stopped all of that somehow, broke up with the third one. I had dreams of making money so I decided to learn marketing from guys like Iman gadhzi, Andrew Tate...etc.
but after a year of learning and so on, I realized that my progression is really slow + English isn't my main language + I live in Syria  so It's a bit hard to talk to Americans since the media makes Syrians terrorists. So, those are the sensible problems, but there are internal problems like I was litterally struggling to wake up early (which is basic thing), struggling to get rid of social media distrations ( I had it from a young age since I was getting annoyed from people that don't respond && checking my phone every moment esp when texting a girl ). So, basically social media and old childhood problems and girls (like no friends, racism  when I was in German ( cuz I am musilm ) were merged together to form a problem I call it ""always distracted by someone I talk to on social media evne though I may not be talking to that person in the moment""  
people haunted me like they look at me all the time.
There is a third internal problem which was stupidity.

I didn't realize those problems at all during highschool cuz life was pretty basic.

I mentioned that I was a muslim and still practically, but since I was dating girls in a religious country && the fact, I have a lot of muslim friends that I printed the image of being a strict muslim in thier heads ( I really was into Islam back then and loved it), make me feel like I am being haunted all the time, like I am doing something wrong.

So, I got rid of the girls thing  as I said becuase it looked meaningless and because I had dreams to be successful. 

So, during the time I was learning marketing, I became a friend with an atheist that had the same interests as me but forced me to think the opposite side of Islam.

This really distracted me from everything except philosophy which I was kind of interested in. 
So, started thinking in life in an extreme way for half a year.

I just was thinking, watching podcasts, reading a bit, going to the gym, learning programming ( cuz my atheist friend and the sensible problems I stated above made me think in a different skill to learn + CS is my major), got somehow rid of all people talking to me in my head, all of my fears.

Then, I reached a point, that I didn't know how to continue thinking philosophically while applying what I conclude, It got complicated so muchin my head, that I now sit the part for 12 hours doing nothing, I don't know what happens,  but what I was always trying to relate, my actions, speech, thoughts  to my  philosophical fundementals that I build half a year ago, but as I said it become hard to connect everything together because of braodness and complexity,  So I started feeling like I am just talking without knowing if what I am saying is true or false.

People take things simple, I feel ""am I the only one that is seeing something really big, horrible to come to judge us all??"" 

There is no guidence, no motivation to continue, no friends, all of it is ditraction from the real stuff but even my brain isn't helping me to reach somewhere. 

my question is, after everything I have done wrong in the past, I beleive I made myself somehow stupid, but now, after I got rid of everything wrong in my life my brain resists to think clearly and help me find continue the journey I began in finding the truth (because everything was and still mainly towards that goal)  and this is making me suicidal",1,0,/r/depression/comments/1jaygvw/life_looks_meaningless/,get straight point past years ago finished highschool wierd tendencies like multiple girl friends watching porn th grade talked lot women attention relationship sex short term got short term relationships haunting day stopped somehow broke third one dreams making money decided learn marketing guys like iman gadhzi andrew tateetc year learning realized progression really slow english isnt main language live syria bit hard talk americans since media makes syrians terrorists sensible problems internal problems like litterally struggling wake early basic thing struggling get rid social media distrations young age since getting annoyed people dont respond checking phone every moment esp texting girl basically social media old childhood problems girls like friends racism german cuz musilm merged together form problem call always distracted someone talk social media evne though may talking person moment people haunted like look time third internal problem stupidity didnt realize problems highschool cuz life pretty basic mentioned muslim still practically since dating girls religious country fact lot muslim friends printed image strict muslim thier heads really islam back loved make feel like haunted time like something wrong got rid girls thing said becuase looked meaningless dreams successful time learning marketing became friend atheist interests forced think opposite side islam really distracted everything except philosophy kind interested started thinking life extreme way half year thinking watching podcasts reading bit going gym learning programming cuz atheist friend sensible problems stated made think different skill learn cs major got somehow rid people talking head fears reached point didnt know continue thinking philosophically applying conclude got complicated muchin head sit part hours nothing dont know happens always trying relate actions speech thoughts philosophical fundementals build half year ago said become hard connect everything together braodness complexity started feeling like talking without knowing saying true false people take things simple feel one seeing something really big horrible come judge us guidence motivation continue friends ditraction real stuff even brain isnt helping reach somewhere question everything done wrong past beleive made somehow stupid got rid everything wrong life brain resists think clearly help find continue journey began finding truth everything still mainly towards goal making suicidal

1jar5z8,1741911809.0,It just isn't fun anymore,"I've been wondering why I have kept going on. Why I haven't killed myself? What has prevented me from doing it?

And I guess, it's fun. Fun has kept me from not offing myself. Or the idea that some day I will have a good time. That there is some future where I can enjoy life and do nice things with my friends.

But now that all seems to be over. World has turned into shit. All my friends have gone away and I am lonely. I'm not especially young anymore (33 years). I have had good times and fun. I've been in loving relationships and done things I dreamed of. But now there just isn't any visible future where I could do something like that again. Times have changed. I feel tired. I don't have the faith anymore. I just see darkness. All my attempts at trying to go somewhere fall apart. Even when I try as hard as I can, I fail. It seems that it really isn't my time anymore.

My only opportunities are either to remain poor and keep some liberty regarding my life or then maybe get some boring office job which eventually kills me from within. I can die in freedom or live as a slave. 

And I have therapist. But somehow I think that won't work either. I mean, my therapist can't change the world I am living in. Therapist can help me with my traumas and all that shit but that doesn't change the fact that my life sucks. 

This just seems to be the end of the line for me. I'm on a platform waiting for the train so that I can throw myself under it.

1jbuduo,1742042957.0,How I lost my soul mate after 10 years.,"I met the love of my life  when I was 18. We met online actually, in an instrumental/ karaoke discord. I would play piano in an empty channel to myself for a couple hours a day, maybe have somebody join for 30 seconds and leave without saying anything. One day I saw somebody sitting alone in their own channel and decided to jump in. She was playing ukulele, over the rainbow of course, I thought it was so insanely cheesy. But I stayed through all of it and said ""your play well, thank you"".. they then left the channel.

A couple days later I was doing my thing alone and the same person jumps into my channel instead....and we didn't stop talking for a single waking moment, for 10 years...

For the entire time I knew this woman she was the light of my life, my purpose for existing. I was suicidal before I met her, I was probably in those empty chat rooms hoping to just find some sort of help, somebody to listen. But instead I found the love of my life, and I betrayed her.

I was on pain killers from the ages of 13 to 20. I was in a bad accident as a kid and my doctor thought it was necessary then. But then the opiate crisis started and without warning they switched me to a bunch of different muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory stuff, you name it, everything except pain killers. 

(20 yrs old) It was really hard for a good year, my then girlfriend was really busy going through nursing school, and I was able to hide how much I was hurting quite a lot, I don't think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest. Not to blame her at all, I hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning. And after the withdrawals left I just had to hide the pain. I probably popped 15 ibuprofen a day back then.. 

(26 years old)  I had the best time of my life with my partner for so many years, dozens of vacations and dinners and movies and countless upon countless nights spent up until 5 in the morning just because we didn't want to fall asleep and end our time together... 

And then I went to a routine doctor check up. I was working a new job at the time, on my feet 12 hours a day, constant lifting, the pain was bad. I told the doctor that, he gave me the same Yada Yada as always about inflammation and exercise and stretching..but at the end he mentioned something, kratom. Some all natural plant that had healing properties. I disregarded him, hippy type doctor, always telling me the cure to life is some plant or to stop eating msg. 

Jump forward a few months and I had to find a new job, last one just wasn't working out. One day a few weeks in im taking out the trash and a neighbor a couple stores down tells me to come over and try their stuff, it's awesome blah blah blah. He mentioned that same name as my doctor, kratom..I gave in and went over one day and they made me this awful, nasty, clumpy orange juice and green powder that refuses to mix with the liquid, death soup shot. Half an hour later, I was astonished, same exact feeling as the pain relievers I was on 6 years ago..

(28 years old)  I'm living in Texas now, with the best job I've ever had, potential to make over 100k a year with bonuses. With the best girl in the world, with prospects of having children and buying a home together. I've won over her mom, her dad, her grandparents, the whole family treats me like a son...but in the background...im wasting hundreds of dollars a week, buying 7hydroxie...a souped up super addictive version of kratom... my life is falling apart, im falling behind on bills to feed my addiction, I don't buy the love of my life a single Christmas present because I'm so behind on bills from wasting so much money...I owe 2000 on my car....

A couple weeks later I got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when I bumped an empty parked car in a lot...I didn't notice any damage and just drove off...it was stupid and I payed the ultimate price for it...later that night when I finally was able to call her....she was distraught, totally inconsolable, telling me that she's going to kill herself for what I've done....she got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottles...my stash of everything...the price tags were on the things...she told me just what was in the car was worth almost $1300...this was 2 weeks after Christmas...

She ended up bailing me out of jail, picking me up,  taking me home...and she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me, she was going to help me through this addiction, she wouldn't abandon me in my time of need. She came up coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff, encouraged my hobbies, she helped with everything. 

I was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the night..she had told me that this was so difficult, she had wished she never found out. She just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have.. I encouraged her to slap me, to wake me up and that I was going to try so hard to give her everything in the world...but after she went to bed I couldn't sleep, I paced for 5 hours back and forth...all I could hear in my head was her crying..telling me how hard I made this on us...all I could think to myself was im not good enough for her....so what does it matter anyways...so i took her credit card and went and bought more drugs.. then I raced home and pretended everything was normal...I took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since I felt her hand on my face... 

Later that day she was out with her mom and I got a call....she knew everything. She saw the bank charge, she saw me leave on our ring cam, she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs... the addiction, she would help me through , but this was like the 3rd or 4th time that I stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as well..I never begged for another chance so hard in my whole life...I was out in the streets, living out of my car, lost my job...a week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded. Truly homeless at this point. Another homeless person steals my bags of clothes, food, and blanket, a couple days later...

Im back in colorado now...I've been clean since the last moment I saw her... over 30 or 40 days I wana say...I tried to kill myself last night..she had called me out of the blue...and I had been planning to do it soon anyways so I figured..if I can die listening to her voice that would be pretty good...I swallowed 6 bottles of sleeping pills I had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talking...she caught on when my words started to slurr and I told her what I did...at first I tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take.. I waved over a cop and just remember puking my guts out... I really don't know what to do now...

We were each other's firsts loves...first everythings...hug, kiss, date, valentines, vacation...and for me she'll always be my last. Wether I end up living another 50 days or 50 years, she will be the last woman I ever touch, love, think about at night, and when I wake up in the morning... my life was truly ruined, stolen, ripped up into shreds, and stomped on...because I got addicted to a drug...please nobody follow my example....it leads to hell.

1jb82wd,1741969947.0,Help,"Yeah, guys… I've hit rock bottom. You know that war on drugs? Well, she always won. You will always win.

This week I received an ultimatum from my family: either I go to rehab, or they will forget I exist. Just like that. For them, I've already lost control. And, to be honest, maybe they're right. I've been using drugs for as long as I can remember. Depression only gets worse. Anxiety eats away at me. And when I'm sober, my mind becomes hell. So every day, I look for something stronger to numb me. Anything (except crack and cocaine). But the rest... the rest I accept.

I'm not going to lie: this incessant search for pleasure is tiring. Tired as hell. I still don't know exactly when I'm going to the clinic, but I hope I can make it until then.

I just wanted to vent. Sorry for getting off topic in the sub.

1jbp0de,1742020141.0,"Cold Turkey WD after 10 yrs on Sub, my story...hope it helps","I won't bore you with the addiction story...you've probably heard it before...and it ended with the start of this one. I'm a Veteran, so I went to the VA clinic for help with prescription opiates and was prescribed Suboxone...the new (at the time) miracle drug, and for me, it was. It saved my life.

First 4 years I was prescribed 24 mg/day and over the next 6 yrs I eventually got it down to 8 mg/day....10 years total on this drug. My Dr called it a ""lifetime"" medication. I didn't like that at all.

I also hated the random UA's I needed to submit to stay on it (which were always clean btw), the myriad of side effects I'd experienced over the years and the look of judgement from others after hearing what med I was being prescribed.

Three weeks ago I woke up one morning and decided to quit cold turkey and not be tied to it anymore. I didn't discuss it with my Dr ahead of time (I'm certainly NOT recommending anyone go this route)..I just didn't show for my monthly appt or request a refill. Here's how it went for me:

Days 1-3

No physical withdrawal symptoms...maybe a little anxiety for what I (thought) was coming. Mentally psyching myself up for it.

Days 4-5

Anxiety has definitely set in hardcore. Appetite gone. Feeling ""antsy"" and irritable. Low energy. Still bathing daily though. Staying positive mentally.

Days 6-8

RLS and insomnia arrived. No vomiting, minimal nausea and only one (1/2) visits with the diarrhea fairy. Don't trust it's gas during this time. Feeling like I'm coming out of my skin. Arms, legs and body occasionally jumping(spazzing). Irritability has progressed to extreme bitchiness. Couldn't even stand it when my toddler touched me. Was either laying in my bed or lying in the recliner. Hot and cold flashes. All time low on energy. Didn't leave the house at all. Only showered once in these 3 days.I didn't have the strength to put conditioner in my hair after half-ass washing it...and shaving, ha ha...nope

Mentally sending out positive thoughts and energy and directing them to the negative WD symptoms. Maybe the mind over matter saying is true because this does seem to help, alleviating the symptoms...for a time, but not long. They come back.

Day 9

Delirious from the insomnia. Previous symptoms still here, maybe to a lesser degree, thankfully. New symptom is night sweats. Soaked shirt and pillow. Left the house today but fell asleep in the car while waiting to pick my kids up at school. Something has got to give soon...I keep telling myself that.  I attempt to ""mentally will the WD away"" This seems to work for a bit but  it's not enough.

Day 10-Today (day 20)

Researching online for things to help alleviate the symptoms, homeopathic or otherwise.  Kratom keeps popping up....I've got kids, a husband and a life to get back to, you know. So I went to the neighborhood vape shop and got a bag of Kratom capsules. No experience with it, have never taken it before so I really had to read a lot online to try and figure out the dosing and let me say, there's not much info out there. But I REALLY needed to get a nights sleep. I took 4 capsules with a huge glass of water two hours before bed. Slept for close to 5 hours straight. No RLS.

Woke the next morning feeling like maybe the tide had finally turned. I began taking three capsules mid morning, late afternoon and then before bed for the next few days. It took care of all the symptoms except for the lack of energy. Still no energy but I was able to return to a version of my life. Still experiencing some insomnia here and there. Have had night sweats twice. No energy.



\*\* LET ME BE CLEAR\*\*  I have no intention of replacing the Suboxone with Kratom, I understand the biology behind the reason the Kratom helps to relieve the symptoms and I also know that the biology/reason is what makes the Kratom addictive as well. Which is dangerous for me, since I'm an addict. With this in mind, I gauged my symptoms and I began going longer without and consistently taking less of the Kratom. Now on Day 20, I will only take the capsules tonight before bed. Maybe tomorrow I wont even take them then.

All in all I feel like if anyone should of had a extremely rough WD it would be me....10 years taking it every day is real dependency. I read so many horrible WD stories and I feel for each of them. But mine wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Yes, there were a few bad days, one in particular where I almost called my Dr for a refill. And yes, I found Kratom, which almost removed all the physical symptoms. But its not for everyone.  There are some who aren't comfortable with it or feel its just a replacement.

I really did try to stay positive mentally, putting an actual daily effort into sending positive thoughts out and directing them toward the WD. I firmly believe this played a part in lowering the severity of what I experienced.

My take on this is this.....just as addiction is uniquely personal so is the WD experience. No matter where you are in this journey, hang in there, stay positive and live to fight another day. Blessings.

""Schneeberg"" is a legal menthol powder intended for usage at the Oktoberfest between beers. It is just a menthol powder that you can do bumps off of or do lines of.

1jbjb75,1742000077.0,Trouble self medicating coming off suboxone and poor communication with doctors,"Hey guys. Bear with me, 20M, as I’ve tried to self medicate through a suboxone withdrawal but have miserably failed. I feel like I’ve progressed backwards and replaced one drug with the other (clonazepam). For the past week I’ve been extremely dizzy and have lost balance when walking. Id just like some help here. Any advice is appreciated.

I’ve started weening off suboxone a few months ago and haven’t had much success with my doctors in the communication and therapy department. One of my doctors is my primary care doctor, and the other is an ATS doctor. The ATS doctor prescribes me suboxone. Today, the ATS doctor denounced the newest prescription of clonazepam by my primary care doctor, whos given it to me as damage control for my vertigo and physical symptoms of withdrawal. Mind you, I’ve been taking clonazepam already for months, but this is the first real prescription I’ve got. Again, it helps with my dizziness and physical symptoms of withdrawal.

In the end the ATS doctor said not to pick up the clonazepam prescription because they can’t give me any more suboxone if I have more than one controlled substance under my name. I told him I would try clonidine first, and if it doesn’t work, I’d pick up my first ‘real’ prescription of clonazepam. (You can see probably see my desperation by now). My Primary care doctor actually recommended the clonidine for the suboxone withdraw a few months ago, so that’s how he prescribed it once I mentioned it. 

I have the clonidine now, and I’m ready to take it tomorrow morning for my dizziness . I’ve read a lot of forums online saying it’s a blood pressure medication, and it can be dangerous. I was actually prescribed gabapentin by my primary care doctor too, around the time he referred clonidine, and it made me have an intense vertigo episode from my own bed, so that’s why I’m so paranoid. 

I’ve also read that benzodiazepines are dangerous to your CNS and can cause brain damage. With how I’ve been feeling lately, the dizziness, the brain fog, and feeling like the ground is moving, I can see how that’s true too. I just don’t know what’s causing what and frankly neither do my doctors. 

Again, If anybody here has an ounce of advice, even subpar, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much.

1jbis9v,1741998496.0,I guess I’m looking for help,"So um hi you lovely people 
I just want to intrude my self I’m mash 
I’ve been weed everyday since 2015-2016
I’ve was also smoking cigarettes about 10 everyday and drinking to get drunk every 2 days or 2-3 times a week 

I had to quit smoking due to losing my left big toe to cigarettes 
That was 5-6 years ago but I still continued to drink and have weed 
(I’ve got photos of the toe if you guys wanted to see) 
7 months ago I started to lose my second toe on my left foot due to smoking and drinking 
And for the first few months I was sober it felt nice but I was stressed out so much then came Christmas my fiancé turned into a horrible person due to trying to quit cigarettes 
Plus other family matters made it horrible to stay sober so I started drinking again no where near as much as I used to but I started drinking again 
I thought maybe after Christmas shit will die down nope shit just keep getting worse for me 
I’m 29 been in and out of hospital 7 years due to that I can’t hold down a job and due to my foot I can’t even exercise right at all 
So I’m broke fat bold starting life again from scratch my dad has pulled his back so I’m constantly helping him ( his girlfriend won’t help him at all) my mum has a broken wrist so I’m constantly helping her 
My fiancé is the love of my life but we don’t live together due to bills and rent would go up if we did at this time (we are that scratched for cash) 
That’s just some of the stresses not big ones but dealing with it daily is just honestly not great 
So last Tuesday I smoked weed again 
And continued till yesterday last night 
Due to my foot getting worse more pain and swelling 
I’ve been struggling hard with depression and anxiety due to ptsd from shit Childhood and just some bad adhd 

At the end of the day I’m happy to have some family support I’m just tired I’m over sitting on my arse for 7 years on and off due to gaps where I could work and did but get injured again due to more blood flow to the foot caused horrible pain and recently I’ve been cleared to work as a taxi driver so I’m very happy about that but they lost my taxi driver’s license in the mail so been chasing that up. 

But it’s just time that’s stressing me out the most I’m 29 no savings no house bla bla bla bla 
I know it’s all time 
Exercise takes time 
Healing takes time 
Saving up takes time 
Everything I want to do and achieve all takes time
And it’s just so…..your mind can only wait for so long you know before you snap with the pill of stress just mounting up 
Ps I wouldn’t of smoked again if in my country it was recreational so that way I could go to a store and just get some edibles (no dealer I know makes them and I’m not gonna waste flower on making a shit batch that shit is expensive)

1jb8r0x,1741971652.0,Support for my son...,"Ok. I am a recovering alcoholic which makes this quite painful and relatable at the same time ...

My 26 yr old son just admitted to me that he and his wife (they are both trans and just got married) had been doing cocaine for a while and we're having a lot of problems bc of it ... But that they were trying to work it out. That was a couple weeks ago. 

I woke up yesterday to my son ranting on FB about how did this happen and about his heart being broken...you get the point. I texted him immediately and he didn't want to talk about it. He just told me they had split up and that he didn't know where it would go from here. He talked about not hurting her like Papa had hurt me, but then it has fallen apart for them anyhow. 

As far as I can tell (from the little he has shared since then) they are working on it but they both keep posting memes and old pics of each other together and happy all over FB...It absolutely KILLS me inside bc I don't know how he is feeling and I don't want my first born to go thru ANOTHER heartache. Jesus. He is 26 and he has had enough heartache and stress in his life already. Long story, and yes, it involves my alcoholism as a HUGE part of why he has mental health problems now. I am not pressuring him bc as a mother I want to know but I know from personal experience that if someone is in a state where they truly can not discuss what is happening...that it is better to leave it alone for the moment than to pry. There is a time and place for trying to get him to open up to me, but it is not now. I will wait for him to come to me, and I will sit with my anxiety and deal with it myself and thru my own mental health team bc that is what we do as moms...and should do as humans. Empathy and sympathy are free skills to learn people. I will deal with it and let him deal with it and when it's time ... He will come to me. That is our relationship. I will continue to support him 100%.

So my question is how best can I do that? I know NOTHING about cocaine at all except it's a powder, or you can take it by IV or you can smoke it ... I know little about it's effects. Tbh I know know lots more about ketamine abuse than anything bc of Elon Musk. How sad is that? I just want to know what to say and not to say as he deals with this...both his breakup and the drug use which are related...and separate problems at the same time. He is looking into rehabs and all. He is more than capable but I am here to catch him if he falls. He isn't a person who has abuse issues that have been going on for years, so I'm hoping that he is strong enough to overcome. Mama is there for support bc I know how hard it is to kick something like a drug (alcohol) and what it's like to NOT have support for that. My husband gave me NO support as I was struggling with drinking. It took getting so drunk and passing out at a public restaurant to snap me right out of whatever stupidity I was embroiled in at the time. It was a HARD decision and it took months to be able to start my abandonment of alcohol. It had been my friend since I was 14 (so since the year 1985) and I officially quit on September 11 2016. Yes ... Weird date. I know but I was just fed up with being fat and tired and sickly...so I was done. 

Thanks for your help guys. I empathize but I don't want to make excuses for him or anything. He isn't doing that and he is keeping a positive and proactive attitude about it.

1jawl9w,1741929583.0,I wrote a poem about getting sober and recovery tonight and wanted to share.,"From “drugs” perspective to you 
“Then something happens and you have to choose, 
to succumb to the temptation that I give you or choose,
To get help to rise up or fall and you lose.

It won’t be easy and it will be tough, 
but if you can fight, you can get out of the rough, 

If you have reason and if you have will,
Then you can get out and have a life you can love still,

Because sobriety is earned and even though it’s hard, 
every day that you are sober is an accomplishment on the card. 

You love and you learn, but if you get through,
Then the ones you love will love the new you. “

1jaxgkw,1741933378.0,"He’s being sober and opening up, I’m so proud","Although this is not a progress update for me, I think he still deserves the appreciation!

For context, My bf has been struggling with his addiction to his stimulant pills. He took off days to get high. Like sitting in his bed and just taking pills in and out. I was devastated to hear this although I assumed it with some signs- How he couldn’t sleep but never texted me (when he’s high he’s very honest which he admitted already), How he suddenly had a huge anxiety spike of not wanting to hurt me or be a bad boyfriend, Suddenly being reclusive, etc. 

I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he could handle it …it’s what he wanted… until he was ready-

It was worse than I coul-no wanted to imagine. I hoped addiction would let go of him as he struggled but life isn’t fair.

His mom had given him more pills and enabled his addiction due to her thinking he needed to be high as her health deteriorated.

Which is exactly what happened.

Everyday, at his job, any chance he got. He couldn’t do it anymore. He talked less. He hasn’t told me the amount he took but the last time he saw me he was already at taking 16 100mg pills. 

But when his mom had a heart attack, he realized he needed to sober up. 

If he hasn’t taken any recently, he’s almost at 4 or 5 days sober :)💕.

He reached out to me on his own terms and started to update me about the multiple things that have happened and eventually his personal feelings. 

He was crying and frustrated saying that he’s not strong enough for this.

He’s only 19, though nobody can be strong enough to feel everything start to slip from his hands and be okay.

We talked for hours and although he didn’t like all of my advice and being vulnerable- He listened and understood I cared.

He updated me yesterday about updates in his life and I told him some short cuts to help reduce stress like waiting on quitting his old toxic job until the end of the week or when he’s ready since he just regained some stability he just got with his mom coming back home from the hospital.

He asked if we could hang out soon and I told him I’d love to once I feel better (I’m a bit sick right now). And I’m so proud that he’s able to process what’s going on now although the withdrawals are intense right now.

I gave him so tips in order to deescalate the anxiety and attack itself by distraction, relaxing or sleeping, working up a healthy body again- It’s how I helped my mom get back up, I just hope it’s the right advice. 

I’m so proud even if I’m worried about well…everything.

But to face addiction you have to build yourself into a reason to sober up. Self regulation and centering is how you escape the cycle without dependency, right?

I’m reassuring him as we work through this. I’ll hopefully update this as we get better.

1jax5qj,1741932030.0,IV Meth missed shot. Advice?,"Background/Unnecessary info: 

I have a few questions about misses.
I've been using IV a little over a year now and had been doing a good job of being ""respectful"" to my body (careful and listening to it, staying hydrated, not trying when I knew I wouldn't be able to get it). I had very little trouble hitting most of the time (a couple rough patches due to mental blocks but relatively unscathed) until recently. 

It seemed to happen overnight. One day I had virtually no bumps and the next day I had a pretty large bump. Large enough that I feel I should be able to recall what time caused it, but I can't. Then smaller bumps started showing up at my preferred sites. This is less concerning as I believe I've identified the issue as being my angle.  I've apparently become too comfortable/confident/lazy and am working to remedy this.

**REASON FOR POSTING**

I missed big time today out of frustration and pure idiocy. I  knew better but got tunnel vision and failed to talk sense to myself. 

 I've been told to do a warm compress and to try and massage it out. That's worked before, but this is a bigger miss than I'm used to dealing with and am looking for any other tips/tricks. I've also been told taking antibiotics, applying Prid and using compression wraps could be helpful, but I am uncertain about their effectiveness. Does anyone have experience with these methods? I wouldn't apply something like Prid over an injection site until I was confident the skin was healed in fear of causing infection. I also don't understand how Prid works and question how effective it would be at drawing anything like that out...

Also, would injecting sterile water at the site of the miss help dissolve it better? It sounds like a good idea but I've never heard of anyone doing that and I'm hesitant to try something like that out on myself. Not that advice from strangers on the internet is any less scary, but I'm hoping  for the best.

1ja80th,1741858059.0,20 and Fighting PIED – My Story,"
Hey everyone, this feels weird to post since I mostly used Reddit for… well, porn. But here I am, finally taking this seriously. I’ve been battling this addiction for four years now. I had moments where I thought I beat it—turns out, I was wrong.

I started watching porn at 12, never thinking about the effects until I first tried to have sex at 16… and couldn’t perform. I shrugged it off, but it happened again at 17. That’s when I found out about PIED. I tried to quit, thought I recovered at 19 when I finally lost my virginity, but I was just barely getting by. The moment that relationship ended, I fell right back into it.

Since then, I’ve had multiple failed encounters. One girl, who I adored (and was literally a model, like wtf), might’ve been different if I’d just been honest. But I wasn’t. I kept making excuses—anxiety, low testosterone—when deep down, I knew porn was wrecking my confidence. I’ve got the looks, I hit the gym, but when it comes to sex? I feel like a fraud.

A  month ago, I decided enough is enough. No more excuses. If you’re dealing with this too, you’re not alone. Let’s quit this together. Porn isn’t worth the anxiety, the lost moments, or the self-doubt.

when i got clean originally, i told my wife. she has a very extensive history with addicts in her life/family. she told me ""addiction ends in two ways, you recover... or you die."" at first i kinda tried to shrug it off. i mean id never had a lethal overdose. i never shot up. i never even as much as smoked a pill. she's known about my drug use since she's known me but she is 100% sober. i hid my worsening substance issues from everyone in my life, including her. i apparently did very well because she was completely blind sided (she knew i smoked weed and occasionally drank but that's it) 

i did the majority of my responsibilities for a few months, kept up the facade. went to work, tried to stay in college. thought i was giving it my all. ""living up to my potential"" but there's always that monster in ya. chasing the dragon. it went from ur stereotypical 1x a week... ok 2x... maybe 4x... ok not today(fail)... okay maybe not tmrw(fail).... then you're at every day and so forth.  i really thought i was in control. things were ok for awhile of course until they weren't. i first lost my job. mental health got fucked up because i really enjoyed that place. priorities began to get out of wack. got another job, but i lost my scholarships, flunked out of the semester. lost my relationship with my friend. my relationship with my siblings and mother dwindled. wife says i'm a different person during this. i was getting high and it started to make me sick for whatever reason (ur run of the mill itchy, nauseas, constipated from pills) 

through all this, i've still been convincing myself ""it wasn't that bad"" but what she said has really stuck with me. i was so very close to extending my use, knowing very well that in my area that you're very very likely to consume fentanyl at any point when messing with any of this stuff, meaning just 1 pill can kill. 

for me, she's right. i'm one of those people that can't have a beer without getting blackout 9x/10. i was going to keep chasing the dragon with this shit.  but i try to think of it as : 

for today, i have a choice. i can choose life or the dragon.

i know where this is going, and it's up to me to decide.

1jait89,1741890051.0,Has anyone experienced what I’m going through?,"Backstory: I’m now 30 and currently sober 6 months from drink and drugs, my choice. Throughout my late teens and 20s I was the classic piss head on the weekends. Eventually the drugs started getting involved as well (basically everyone is doing it now) and there were nights that would be me and my friends drinking and would end up getting a few bags in (cocaine) and it would go from there. This went on for a good 12 years or so in total and I eventually had enough last year and said I  changing my lifestyle around and that’s exactly what I’ve done, don’t drink, smoke, do drugs etc gone completely straight edge. 

For the last 2-3 years it has slowed down massively anyway as things do once you start to get older and I would drink and take drugs only a couple of times per year. However what’s really odd to me and quite worrying is the dreams I’m having. I dream 1-2 times per week the same sort of dream. I’m out with my friends i’m drunk, I’m high on drugs and whatever and I’m conscious of the time and how I’ve been out all night and need to go home. I then have the fear and dread of sneaking back into my house avoiding waking people up and avoiding bumping into people if it’s 7-8AM. This is all real life situations I had put myself in for years and it seems that for the past 2 years whilst I have been physically doing this less frequently I am now experiencing it in my dreams instead?  It’s all so vivid as well like I can remember getting home at 9am and having no sleep been up taking drugs all night and having to lay there in bed and sleep the full day away and how that made me feel so paranoid and anxious. 

I’m sorry for the ramble and it may not all make sense but just wondering if anyone can relate to this? Anyone know what’s causing these dreams to be so frequent? Do I need therapy? It’s quite concerning. Thanks for reading, will answer any questions as best I can in the comments.

1jab2qy,1741869823.0,I feel sad that my mum don't trust me,"I've been an addict for about 7 years and about 10 weeks ago I finally got out of it. I have lied about my addiction many times. I understand why she don't trust me, I probably wouldn't either

I do understand it, it just hurts me. I'm doing everything i can to stay sober. And I just had a dream that I was drinking again and then kept questioning if I was. I have OCD, so I doubt literally everything, especially when it comes to myself. I already have thoughs about ""did I drink? The thing I tasted my friend said had no alcohol, did it really not? I smelled alcohol, could I have gotten an effect from that?""

This was just a very bad start of the day, especially because of the dream and I'm scared I will relapse again

And I can't tell how again I didn't drink, because I have hidden it and lied about it many times and broke her trust.

1ja5rng,1741847363.0,I recently became addicted to a hard drug.,"Trigger warning gonna talk about hard drugs and sexual addiction.

 (Coming back after writing, this post is very long and a bit jumbled but I hope you might take the time to read it, maybe youll find some value and maybe share your thoughts)

So, I am in my mid twenties and have been having a really rough year. I've been unemployed for almost a year, moved into one of my parents basement, and haven't been doing a good job of maintaining any friendships.

I've been a heavy pot user for a long time, since around 17 years old. I have had periods of time quitting it for a month or multiple successfully. Before ever trying weed I became addicted to porn around 12 years old.

Porn addiction escalated to sexual addiction. I have fucked more people then I could ever possibly remember. I'm a gay guy and it's incredibly easy to find casual sex in today's world thru a few taps on your phone. I would say my sex addiction has become my biggest problem.

Recently however, I made a really stupid decision when I was feeling really down in December, and I tried smoking crystal for the first time with a hookup. And I really liked it. I found It made it so much easier to talk to people, gave me energy and motivation to clean, and honestly made me more empathetic towards others. Also made me not very hungry and I've always struggled with being overweight and over eating so that was a plus for me.

I then proceeded to try a few more times over the next month, and eventually ended up getting some of my own. I did it a handful of times, and ended up going down rabbit holes on reddit and YouTube and learning about all the dangers and side effects and all that. I thought I could keep it to like once a month, but quickly found myself doing it every few days, and multiple times a day when I did do it.

It a moment of clarity, I got rid of all of it. And I felt both happy and sad. Happy I was able to throw it away for my own sake, but also sad because it felt like the best antidepressent I've ever had. I never thought I would do a hard drug. I'm the type who would always discourage friends from doing that when I had friends lol.

Managed to be completely sober for almost 2 months, even from weed, because I was scared of the path I was on.

Had to get surgery, and during recovery was pretty down so I picked up weed again, which was fine I just smoked and played games.

But when looking for a hookup recently, I came across the guy who sold me the crystal, and stupidly got more. Because I had gained weight during recovery from surgery, and thought it would help me lose weight/clean my house better.

I now realize that is the addict in me just wanting to feel that high again. I got a 8 ball this last Sunday, smoked Sunday and Monday, break on Tuesday (told myself I'd give myself at least a week till trying again).

Then proceeded to wake up today, Wednesday, and do some before cleaning up my house. Then got alot of stuff done that I've been needing to. Smoked a bit more in the afternoon.

And I kept looking up the dangers. The stories of people ruining their life. The permanent damage it can cause. Or even death. Heart problems. Ruins your teeth. People going to prison, becoming homeless, stealing from their families.

And I just can't get out of my head that I've made a massive mistake. That the negatives would far out weigh the positives if I didn't stop.

So I flushed it all down the toilet.

I can't believe I'm addicted to crystal so fast, but I am. I dont wanna ruin my life even more. I'm scared of this path.  After getting rid of everything today I felt the same way I did last time. Good and bad. I'm truly addicted. But I know I made the right choice to throw it all away. Even if i was basically flushing money down the toilet. I looked myself in the mirror and said I'm proud of you and almost cried.

I feel I am rambling now, but just wanted to share where I'm at.

Im addicted to sex, weed, jacking off, video games, and was stupid enough to try a highly addictive hard drug. And now I am addicted to that too.

My inner child deserves better. He had a really hard childhood and I want to be someone he can trust and feel safe with. I went on a long walk outside, no phone no nothing. And I kept thinking of back when I was a kid. He would not want this for me. I know if I don't kick the hard drugs, it will lead me down a dark hellish path.

I already had a dark childhood. I deserve to have a period in my life where things aren't so bad. But im still struggling. Struggling to hold a job, to make and keep friends, to be a person I feel proud of, to make good choices.

Im sorry to myself. I want to do better, to be better. I want to have a boyfriend one day and I don't want an open relationship, i wanna be able to cuddle and feel safe with them and play games and help each other grow and put all the casual sex behind me. But I feel I can't pursue a relationship in my current state.

If you read this far thanks I'm sorry that this was so long. This was kind of just me venting. The next few days I know I'm gonna feel weird with the crystal withdrawals. I deleted the app where I met the guy who has it, I pray I have the strength to control myself better in the future.

Please please don't ever try crystal guys. If you haven't, please don't do it. It's true what they say, it only takes one time to become addicted.

I wish anyone else that struggles with any addictions the best of luck, I believe in you. Your worth fighting for, please don't give up hope.

1ja0yk2,1741830356.0,Passing of estranged friend,"I was addicted to drugs for 10 years. Most of that time was spent using with my best friend then. At the end, we were both IV heroin users. I ended up pregnant in 2011 and went to treatment and ended up asking her to come visit and bring me something. I relapsed and gave my daughter to my mom and continued to use. I finally went to my last treatment center in 2016 and completely cut ties with her. I felt this was necessary for me to stay clean. And for the last seven years, I’ve been back in my hometown where she also lives and have never cross paths with her. I’ve had so many thoughts of reaching out and trying to not even rebuild the friendship, but just have some sort of closure, maybe but I never did. I checked in on her social media a lot and had heard through mutual friends that she was doing well.  Her brother posted about her passing this past Sunday from an overdose. I have really been struggling with feeling like a fraud by even being upset. I feel like I don’t know if I should go to the funeral. We had such a enabling complex relationship. We went through some traumatic stuff together. I was there when her father committed suicide and she was with me through break ups and miscarriages. We did things that hurt each other, and it took time to forgive and heal from those hurts and now I can’t tell her that I’m not holding onto those things anymore and that I still care about her so much. I never shared any of these thoughts with anyone about reconciling with her because my family and close loved ones despised her and blamed her for my addiction turning into what it did. I just always felt like I was supposed to not care… that because I had changed my life that not having her in my life wasn’t supposed to hurt.

1j9vjef,1741815412.0,I feel stupid. Have I done permanent damage to my brain?,"I'm M and I just turned 22 and I feel like my drug abuse has made me stupid. Long story short, I haven't spent a month sober since I was sixteen (not through lack of trying). About half way through sixteen is when I started using drugs. I smoked weed everyday for probably four years, I've done MDMA, cocaine, mushrooms, benzos, dmt, probably tripped acid around 150-200 times, snorted God knows how much ketamine, speed and snorted meth a couple times, and drank a bit too. I haven't been addicted to every substance but I have abused them all pretty substantially. I feel like it's fucked my brain irreversibly, like I don't see how my brain can go through what it's gone through and not be fucked, especially with ketamine and psychedelics. I had some depersonalization kind of stuff going on for like three years after a really bad mushroom trip, which I thought for sure broke my brain, and all the other substances I abused at the time definitely didn't help. I used to be a pretty intelligent kid in highschool, I was into heavily into physics, I was pretty good at math, interested in astronomy and also heavily into philosophy. Now a days I feel like I can barely think straight, or deeply about anything, and just stew in negative thoughts. I feel like I can barely articulate myself at all, think ahead, focus or solve problems. Have I fried myself? Is it just a negative affirmation that I just just keep calling myself stupid? Or is it really bad brain fog and I just need to give it a while to pass? Has anyone else felt like this and got back their ability to function normally? I feel like I can still learn new things but I can't articulate my ideas and what I'm thinking to other people. Honestly I've had some great times on drugs, but I've also put myself and the people around me through fucking hell, with episodes of drug induced psychosis, bad trips, freakouts, cravings and comedowns, but I feel like I'm out of control.

1j9hxr2,1741779123.0,My stepfather overdosed today,"Today is the day that my (28 M) stepfather (47 M) died of a heroin overdose. Since the age of 14, he has been in and out of mine, my brothers (21 M) and my mothers (46 F) life. Him and my mum also had twins (6 F). 

For the majority of his and my mums relationship, he has been an alcoholic, where my mum has broken up with him more times than I can count due to his drinking habits and cocaine use.

She had been with him for around 15 years, and it was mostly him lying about not drinking and taking drugs as it lead to him losing jobs, spending money from a joint bank account and disregarding any type of responsibility he had.

He also had been given around 100k of inheritance money and didnt work for 2 years, spending all the money on drink, drugs and takeaways etc.

Overall, he wasn't a bad person, but was controlled by addiction and he had brought my mum down with him. My mum is currently studying for her masters and has a good job, her own home and has done really well for herself, but has been trying to combat his addiction for over a decade and a half. So I feel for her right now as she's done everything she could to try and help him.

He was due to get a government property in the next few months so my mum was housing him until then, but 2 weeks ago he left by his own choice as he was willing to sleep on the street for drink and drugs and it wasn't until 3 days ago that we found out he had been using heroin after mixing in with a certain group of people.

My mum said that the girls will be waiting for him for when he beats his addiction last night and she didn't get a text back.

Today we found out that he died of a heroin overdose this morning. I wouldn't say that he was a father figure to me, as he came in late in my life, but he was to my brother and of course, my twin sisters, so maybe thats why I dont feel as distraught as they do, but I do feel sad to think what was running through his mind at the time of death.

When we found out that he was using heroin 3 days ago, I was saying to my mum that I was going to drive round to the place he was staying and try to take him away, but now its too late. I never expected this to happen so quick.

This is a brief overview of his life and addiction and there is alot more to it.

I would just like to say that if any of you guys are in the same boat that my stepfather was in, and you have people trying to pull you out of addiction and also love and care about you, please try everything in your power to take that offer to get out of it.

I can't imagine what his state of mind was in at the time this has happened, but I do feel very sad for him and most of all, my twin sisters who will now grow up without a father.

My whole family is hurting..

1j9yfpk,1741823103.0,Taking in my brother who has addiction,"My brother is an alcoholic and also addicted to weed. Going through potential divorce and he's coming to stay with me and my daughter.



However, I am physically disabled and reliant on medical marijuana for pain relief. I tried to quit in the past but my body is very reactive to meds and despises pain medicine, so I've stuck to weed in various forms. I hope that my casual use of weed or alcohol won't be a problem for him or that we can find work arounds. He is at the beginning of his journey and I want to make it easy as possible for him to stay on track. Any related stories would be very helpful.



EDIT: we don't have many choices here.. If we don't take him in he ends up homeless. The place I currently live in is owned by my parents and has enough room for him until we have to move in about 6 months. His insurance will not cover long term facility. He is still able to hold a job and do most things for himself. I have a sister who doesn't have to consume weed who offered to take him in , but she also has 2 kids and lives in the middle of nowhere so it would be difficult for him to work from there.

That being said i had a drink, i’m a bartender apprentice so this is somewhat part of my job.
I tried a lemon drop, it was a decent little drink i haven’t made so knowing how it’s supposed to be made and learn more was nice.
I was pretty upset with myself in certain ways because honestly i just felt super self conscious. it took me about 1-2 hours to sip down a martini. my gfs family kinda judged me because they were on drink 3-4 and i’m sipping a girly drink and not really on their level.

personally i was scared to throw off my calibration as i’m quitting weed. i have felt very high highs and usually they are followed by very low lows. i rather feel very little to nothing then over do it and feel like a alien on earth. i feel i’ve struggled to ground myself to reality in general. so adding another substance that i personally never really liked doing unless with very certain people in very certain setting have made this very hard on me.

That being said though i’m happy with my self control. even though it was based on fear rather then confidence. apart of me wants to get a little off the handle one day on a day off so i can feel comfortable or at least acknowledge that it’s ok and i’m gonna be ok even if decide to have a little fun.

1j9a02u,1741750252.0,Has anyone had similar issues after cocaine?,"Overdid cocaine 15 days ago and put myself in the ER with a heart rate of 160-180 and blood pressure of 179/109. I thought I was having a heart attack… Normally 85-95 is where my heart rate would hang out while using.

Since the incident, i’ve returned to the ER every couple of days over these episodes where i’ll feel a sudden sharp pain in my chest that would cause my heart rate to jump suddenly to 140-170 and cause my body to begin shaking uncontrollably. I don’t know if these are just panic attacks or what (never had panic attacks previously) or if it’s some type of heart arrhythmia. By the time I reach the ER, my heart rate will lower to around 120 or so, but my BP will still be high (159/99 for example), I’ll still be shaking, and my chest will still feel uncomfortable.

The initial ER visit and tests showed slightly elevated troponin and a “concerning” EKG. Subsequent visits showed “high t-waves” on my EKGs and elevated blood pressure (138/91 for example) but x-Ray and everything else normal. Over the last week, my EKG results look normal again and my blood pressure seems to have finally gone back to normal. I’m still dealing with shortness of breath, but it seems to have improved a little too.

I even finally saw a cardiologist yesterday who performed his own EKG, and echocardiogram, and a stress test and he claims my heart looks totally healthy. Haven’t seen the holster monitor results yet though, as I’m still wearing it for a few more days.

I only used cocaine for about three weeks, though I was using (almost) daily and frequently throughout the days. I’ve got all these doctors telling me I’m fine, but I don’t feel fine at all. My chest still has weird aches and pains, my heart rate is still acting weird, and I’ve got more anxiety and depression than I’ve ever felt in my adult life. I get winded from little exertion and my heart rate will increase more than normal while going on walks. (20-25bpm higher than normal) I’ve got this strange sense of doom that I continue to feel throughout most of every day, as if something awful is about to happen to me at any moment.

I wonder if these could all be withdrawal symptoms, but I didn’t really use for that long and it’s now been over two weeks. Additionally, I’ve maybe only experienced a “craving” once or twice, and very briefly.

I’m desperate for answers, as the professionals I’ve relied on for them are giving me answers (“you’re okay”) that totally contradict how I feel. Has anyone ever felt how I feel, or how I’m describing? I will absolutely never use cocaine again for as long as I live. I’m incredibly freaked out and even more embarrassed.

I've been smoking for 4 years now. I started with tobacco, it wasn't my thing because it gave me a lot of dizziness and migraines. Then I started cannabis which was very good until I started hard drugs including a derivative of crack (I don't know what this product is outside my country of origin).
I started feeling pain in my right side chest about 7 months after I started smoking cannabis and this pain has always been present every time I smoke. After 2 years the pain moved to the left side, particularly to the heart. 
Today I no longer feel the stinging pain in my chest on the right side but more on the left side and this pain is like a weight, numbness and difficulty breathing deeply. Apart from that I have had extreme, stinging pain in my heart twice already and I thought it was a cardiac arrest. I also have the impression of having the beginnings of digital clubbing. I have already been to the hospital but the doctor said it was an anxiety-depressive attack. (In short, the doctors don't seem to take my pain seriously).

I stopped smoking for 2 non-voluntary periods, the first lasting 9 months (no pain) and the second lasting 7 months (pain). Today I want to quit smoking only because of the pain, but not from taking drugs. I have always smoked my drugs and have never taken them in any other form. So I don't know what to take to quit smoking more than it would give me other addictions. 

I have a pretty crappy life and being high is the only thing that gives me the strength to get up every morning. I haven't felt the desire to experience this since I was 13 and at 24 today this feeling is even more existent. 
But I can no longer end my life because I have a child now and besides myself I don't trust any other human to take care of me if I am no more. 
I had a difficult childhood with abuse and I would like to protect this child from this world but I don't have the energy. The very circumstances of his birth are an enigma. 

I am writing this with obstructed breathing and pain in my heart and as soon as I publish this text I will go roll a joint. I continue to smoke even more, telling myself that it will eventually kill me with all the warning signals that my body keeps sending me but I don't want to end up in the hospital on life support.

1j8xri5,1741717610.0,Support for my sister,"I'm looking for information on drug rehabilitation treatment centers on the West Coast for my sister who is struggling with addiction. We're located in a West Coast urban center, but I'd like to find something quiet and outside of a city where she can truly on her recovery. She's lived in a downtown area for years and I we both agree it does her no good.

Our situation:

* We cannot afford to pay for treatment and need a facility that offers free treatment or scholarship options.
* Ideally, the program would provide some form of aftercare/ongoing support once she completes the inpatient portion.
* My sister is currently staying in shelters with no other housing options.
* With laws changing quickly in our area, she'll likely be out of her shelter within 3 months.
* She wants to work, but I believe (and she agrees) that she should focus on recovery first.

Some background: My sister has been sober for 4 months now. She often goes through long periods of sobriety but tends to relapse when under extreme stress. Her primary drug of choice is opiates, but she also self-medicates with alcohol, weed, and other substances.

She went to rehab when I first discovered her addiction 5 years ago, but she wasn't ready and left the program. This time feels different. Over the past year, I've watched her create stability for herself—something I hadn't seen before. Now she's asking for my support to enter an inpatient facility, and I believe she's ready to take her recovery seriously.

Our parents and other family aren't in the picture, so it's just me trying to help her. I know I'm asking for a lot without having much to offer in return. If there aren't resources available, words of wisdom from those who have been through similar situations would also be appreciated.

I haven't had much luck making money online. I have a very unique story and i was starting to gain traction on TikTok but I'm pretty sure my TikTok account is shadow banned too. I might just be goin crazy, who knows. I'm starting to feel discouraged and depressed. I know my girl needs me to find a job so she can move back in with me when she gets custody. There's nothing in the world that i want more then for her to move back in so we can be a family, but I feel like I'm falling short. Like I'm letting her down. I feel like I'm stuck in square 1 and all I need to do is find a job to get out.. I hope my prayers are answered soon.

1j8qj82,1741699117.0,Navigating Addiction as a Partner,"I’ve (26F) been with my ex (26M) for 5 years and we broke up last weekend. We own a house together, built a life together, but I found out last weekend that he’s been abusing Xanax and did some awful things that I didn’t know he was capable of. He’s getting help to begin to understand his addiction and hasn’t touched the pills in a week. 

Coming here for advice really. While in a 4 month spiral he stole from my family, deceived everyone, slept with his ex twice while in a relationship with me, and gambled himself into 34k of debt in a single night. I love him, this is so out of character for him. He’s begging me to stay but he claims to have “blacked out” in a majority of these instances and can’t recall details or the reason why he did these things. Candidly, the toughest think for me to get over is the cheating because he ordered my engagement ring last weekend, and in that same day, got high and facetimed his ex for 2 hours in our basement. I believe in him, but is he bs’ing me? Can I believe that he simply can’t recall? 

What hurts the most is that I’m the child of 2 addicts and extremely understanding. I would’ve worked through this with him if he told me, but instead had to find everything out myself so trust is at an all-time low. I’ve been staying at the house to ensure he’s okay because I also found suicide letters he wrote after I found everything out. 

I’m not in the headspace to figure “us” out right now. We both need to focus on ourselves, but he’s begging me for another chance. It would take time before I give that a shot but I want opinions from folks who have struggled with something similar.

1j8pjjv,1741696045.0,Small Group Online,"If this isn't allowed, forgive me.  It's not a service I'm offering, but more of a call to anyone interested in being part of an online group, perhaps once a week?  We can offer support, helpful resources, share our progress or struggles, and keep each other accountable.  There's a lot we do can on our own. Like no ones going to do the work for us.  It has to come from self. But there's a time and place to connect, build, and grow with other people as well. 

A little of my background.  I was a heavy drug user - cocaine, meth, ecstacy, crack, pharmaceutics, alcohol, and even gambling. Spent pretty much 15 years of my life using, and abusing. It's been over 9 years since I last touched any of the above mentioned.  Yet, alcohol has still been a part of my life.  I've cut down drastically. 

Sometimes I'll go months without a drink.  And just recently I had an episode that reminded me of how toxic it is.  My body reacted. I was sick as a dog the next day, throwing up damn near all morning and into the afternoon.  Something I haven't felt and done in a Long time. 

I'm 44, and over the last few years I've been doing a lot of inner work.  It's definitely a process, but has been rewarding in a lot of ways. 

Addiction can strip us bare, and rob us of truly experiencing life, relationships with other people and the world around us.  It can make us feel helpless, alone, ashamed and without any drive or motivation.  It steals our sovereignty.  That's why I'd love to be a part of something where we can support each other on our journey to sobriety, and living a freer, healthier and more fulfilled life.

I didn't do drugs. It's a combination of everything else for a long time (nicotine, drinking, porn) etc. which has fried up my dopamine receptors and this seems to have started this. I've noticed how as time went on, I became more ""flat"" and numb both visually and mentally.

I usually end up having this thinking pattern - I need to have this VERY LAST CHEAT MEAL, otherwise if I don't have it then I will be bothered by the thought of needing to do this VERY LAST CHEAT MEAL forever until I end up doing that cheat meal. So since I will end up doing this cheat meal anyways (which in my mind takes me totally out of balance) then I rather have this last cheat meal today so I am never bothered by this again. It is sometime ""LAST CHEAT MEAL"", sometime ""a particular food"" that I have to eat ""one last time"" but the pattern is often similar and repetitive and the subconscious is extremely strong or I am extremely weak as I end up doing cheat meals.

Sometime I am not even aware that I crave food but I suspect that my food craving is manifesting as these weird thoughts or possibly these thoughts have their own life at this point. I sometime have similar thought patterns with other things too but the food thing seems the most bothersome at the moment.

Anyone familiar with a similar thought pattern or this is particularly my invention and issue?

For years i've been going from addiction to addiction, trying to stop this feeling of nothingness and depression i keep having. Started from self harm, to vaping and cigs, then alcohol and weed. Even tho i'm ""switching"" addictions, i still miss it. Those random urges telling me to harm myself or drink or smoke weed just make my life so much harder than it has to be. I'm currently 2 yrs clean from self harm, and haven't smoked weed for about 5-6 months. All of my friends don't look at smoking weed as this harmful thing, but it ruined me. The amount of harm i caused to the ppl i love while drunk or high fills me wirh guilt every single day. I stopped smoking weed and harming myself just because my boyfriend was here to help me, but it feels like if he isn't there and i get the opportunity to smoke with friends, i'll do it. Even tho u don't, it feels like i will. Every time i meet a person i haven't met in a while and they ask me if i wanna come smoke with them, i almost say yes. Every single time. And it hurts me. The feeling that i can't control my own actions concerning these topics makes me feel so scared. I don't wanna break my boyfriend's trust again, i don't want him to sit next to me after i almost offed myself again. I'm scared. And this feeling just gets worse every day.

1j8631v,1741632383.0,How to help my brother who is addicted to Meth & makes up stories,"Hello, my brother has been going through recovery for a meth addiction.  I am trying to support him but not enable him.  My biggest issue is that he makes up huge stories about why he used.

He is in recovery court & is tested a lot for drugs.  He has court once a week & attends classes. He is homeless as well. We live in a small city & don’t have a high crime rate or anything.

It has been 4 times now that he has told this story after stopping communication with everyone and missing court the next day.  His story is that he was Kidnapped, Tied up, & Forced to do Meth.   He has even told this story once before he was involved with court.  

Each time I had given him a small amount of cash for cigs, food, etc or he sold something for money. 

He will even go as far as going to the hospital & making a report to the cops.

I don’t understand why he tells this same story every time.  And that the kidnappers Force him to use Meth. It is just such an unbelievable lie.   

He has told me occasions when he has used. But when the use results in him missing court he makes up these stories. We are pretty close & I try my best to not be manipulated by him. And he knows I don’t believe these stories.

He has mental health issues as well. I am not sure if this is part of his mental illness or just manipulation or both.

I want to help him.  I’m not sure how to deal with these stories he tells.  Any advice is welcomed.  Thank you.

1j83ri7,1741626712.0,Learned my estranged brother is addicted to something (meth/crack) last night. Not sure what I can/should do.,"For background: My brother (27) and I (30) grew up with our mom and grandparents in the same house where they still live. He was diagnosed with mild Tourette's (physical tics and stutter), asthma, and ADHD. Although we were close as children, he always struggled emotionally. He lacked motivation, performed poorly in school, and prioritized socializing over building his future.

Now, while his high school friends have established careers and families, my brother has descended into dependency and drug addiction. My family enabled him throughout his life. During high school, after a heated argument with our mom where he grabbed a knife (though he didn't use it), she became secretly fearful of him. She even took out a life insurance policy, stating she's more worried about my brother killing her than dying from her health conditions (she's a former smoker and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes).

As I grew up, I developed resentment toward my brother and family for their enabling behavior. When he went to college, my parents bought him a car, which he totaled within three months while getting a DUI. My family would drive four hours round-trip to take him to court-mandated alcohol meetings. After he dropped out, they bought him another car. Meanwhile, I was at a school farther away and had to rely on public transportation to get home.

It felt like they coddled him while I had to earn everything. I worked factory jobs during breaks to support myself, while he remained idle at home or socialized, asking our parents for money. He got a girl pregnant, requiring our mom and the girl's parents to arrange an abortion since neither was employed. He once stole my ID and money to get into bars underage, initially denying it when confronted.

This led me to distance myself from my family. I skipped Thanksgiving my senior year and reduced visits and calls. I previously had a great relationship with them, but their treatment of him damaged it. They seemed to think that since I was successful on my own, I didn't need support, so they gave him everything. When I expressed my feelings, they dismissed them, saying he needed support while I was fine.

The last time I felt proud of him was when he joined the Army National Guard. I was surprised he completed it, but he thrived with structure. During a family visit to his base, he was respectful and seemed genuinely happy.

Everything changed during COVID. He was stationed in NYC and Washington DC during the worst periods, helping with body disposal in mass graves. This experience devastated him. My mom said he wasn't the same when he returned, and everyone noticed. Despite his pre-existing psychological issues, this seemed to break him completely. We all tried to help—I reached out, encouraged him to seek help, contacted the VA about therapy options—but he refused, insisting he was fine. His drinking increased, he began smoking, and would disappear for days without explanation, all while my family financially supported him through his inability to maintain employment.

Last night, my mother called to tell me my brother has become fully addicted to drugs. He showed up demanding $20, claiming a drug dealer was after him and his girlfriend. When my mom suggested calling the police, he became more agitated. After she threatened to call police herself if he wouldn't leave, he finally departed, but only after suspiciously examining the house. She filed a police report in hopes of getting a restraining order, and no one has heard from him since. My mom is terrified of him now, and is hoping he violates the restraining order so that she can involuntarily get him into a program or facility.

He's lost over 50 pounds and looks gaunt. He no longer lives at home, and no one knows his current residence. He recently started dating a woman who's also heavily involved with drugs, whom my mom dislikes. He claimed his phone stopped working, so my mom got him a new one; when he said that one failed too, my grandmother gave him her old phone. Both phones have disappeared, and my mom suspects he sold them for drugs.

I rarely talk to him anymore—90% of his messages were requests for money. I feel guilty for shutting him out when we were younger without explaining why. I simply disliked who he'd become and how my family enabled him. I don't know if I have the right to reach out or help him now. I think about all the times I brushed off his suggestions to hang out, knowing he would drink excessively and expect me to pay (which happened when he visited on my birthday, got drunk, and tried to start a fight).

1j8468u,1741627720.0,I think it’s my fault my uncle relapsed,"Hey all, these past 6 months have been really rough for me and I wanted to share my situation and maybe get some advice. This is gonna be long so, just prepare. Let’s start from the beginning. 7 Months ago, my uncle(25) was a normal functioning human being. He had a good job, he was saving money for a nice car, paying off debts. We all lived together with his parents. It was me, uncle, uncles mom and uncles dad(away most of the time because he works on a ship). He had everything good coming for him. Now he has had an extensive history of substance abuse, specifically cocaine. But at the time, he was completely clean and had his life somewhat figured out. During this month, his mother which is my grandmother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and we weren’t sure if she would make it. While she was undergoing treatment, everything went as it should. He’d come home from work, go to the gym, and repeat. We’d even cruise together or go to the mall and walk around. He didn’t have much friends outside of work, but he had a friend that was big on weed. Uncle wouldn’t smoke weed, because he thought it was a gateway drug. But sometimes, uncle’s friend would give him weed, and uncle would give it to me. This one time, I rolled it inside of a cigarette uncle was smoking, and I guess I didn’t finish all the weed inside the cig and ended up kinda lacing uncle. This is where I think it begins. He started to be more open to smoking weed, and would smoke it more and more as time went on. A month later, uncle’s mom, (my grandmother) is completely cancer free and in remission. I think this fired something off in his brain where he thought he didn’t have to work so much now, that he could live off his parents like he always did. He quit his job, and then his downfall began. He smoked weed every day and there wasn’t one day where he wouldn’t smoke it. Eventually, I find a cocaine baggie on his desk. He starts doing cocaine now, spending every dollar that he was saving for a nice car on cocaine. Maybe 2 weeks later, he starts to cook his own crack and smoke it. It would be almost every day he would smoke crack. He also starts to get out of hand at home. He would steal money from his parents, sell power tools or things of value in the house. Uncle’s parents would force him to get a job or else they’d kick him out, and he does get one. But he has a process where he’d work a month for one paycheck, then quit the job and spend the entire paycheck on cocaine. Then, once he’s out of money he would repeat the process. Eventually, his father (who is away almost all the time because he works on the ship) comes home and is sick and tired of his shenanigans and files a restraining order on him. We all live in the same house, so Uncle would be homeless. This is where we are now. He sold almost all his possessions like his pc and sound system to buy coke. I got him arrested just a couple hours ago because he came here to the house. Sometimes I think to myself and wonder if I hadn’t decided to roll that bit of weed in his cig, this all wouldn’t have happened. It’s just crazy how addiction can turn a good hearted person to a selfish, lazy, person so quickly. I’m only 16, and it’s been mostly me dealing with him because grandma is always at work in the hotel and grandpa is always on the ship. I guess the plan is to keep pushing him to a breaking point until he realizes drugs aren’t getting him anywhere and he quits. But I really don’t even know if that’s how it works.",2,4,/r/addiction/comments/1j8468u/i_think_its_my_fault_my_uncle_relapsed/,hey past months really rough wanted share situation maybe get advice gon na long prepare lets start beginning months ago uncle normal functioning human good job saving money nice car paying debts lived together parents uncle uncles mom uncles dadaway time works ship everything good coming extensive history substance abuse specifically cocaine time completely clean life somewhat figured month mother grandmother diagnosed aggressive form cancer werent sure would make undergoing treatment everything went hed come home work go gym repeat wed even cruise together go mall walk around didnt much friends outside work friend big weed uncle wouldnt smoke weed thought gateway drug sometimes uncles friend would give weed uncle would give one time rolled inside cigarette uncle smoking guess didnt finish weed inside cig ended kinda lacing uncle think begins started open smoking weed would smoke time went month later uncles mom grandmother completely cancer free remission think fired something brain thought didnt work much could live parents like always quit job downfall began smoked weed every day wasnt one day wouldnt smoke eventually find cocaine baggie desk starts cocaine spending every dollar saving nice car cocaine maybe weeks later starts cook crack smoke would almost every day would smoke crack also starts get hand home would steal money parents sell power tools things value house uncles parents would force get job else theyd kick get one process hed work month one paycheck quit job spend entire paycheck cocaine hes money would repeat process eventually father away almost time works ship comes home sick tired shenanigans files restraining order live house uncle would homeless sold almost possessions like pc sound system buy coke got arrested couple hours ago came house sometimes think wonder hadnt decided roll bit weed cig wouldnt happened crazy addiction turn good hearted person selfish lazy person quickly im mostly dealing grandma always work hotel grandpa always ship guess plan keep pushing breaking point realizes drugs arent getting anywhere quits really dont even know thats works

1j7wlya,1741606770.0,I want to help my friend,"*I have set to nsfw as I mention misuse of prescribed meds and depression*

Hi guys. My friend has been going through a bad breakup with his wife of 20 years. He is a lot older than me. I’m 27 he is around 50. He’s my neighbour. He opened up to me about his depression and drug use. He smokes cannabis a lot (not the end of the world) but he is abusing his prescribed pain meds. He had a broken shoulder a few years ago and was put on codiene. He has lied that he is still in pain as he is hooked to the tablets, they have upped them now to dihydrocodiene which from what I searched are a lot stronger. He said to me this morning he nearly had to get me to call an ambulance last night as he “forgot” he had some in the day and took too many at night, so he had 4 in total. I read online that the max is 1x30mg a day and he had 4 yesterday that he can remember possibly more. he said he was breathing slow and deep and was in and out of consciousness but somehow slept it off and survived. I would feel like a bad person if I didn’t at least try to help. But I don’t know where to start. I don’t want to be intrusive or for him to feel like I judge him at all, I don’t, I just care about him. He seems a bit like me, he enjoys the odd bit of company but ultimately needs time to himself as he is going through some stuff rn. We had a good talk about it and I suppose him opening up is a good step but he said he has no intention of giving them up as he “can’t” and has “tried loads”. He is a good man and I want him to find a bigger purpose but again, with my lack of experience I would feel patronising if I tried to suggest anything without knowing enough.

1j7pyid,1741578707.0,A ketamine withdrawal induced rant 💔,"Ket addiction is no joke for people who use it for relief from suicidal ideation. Its been about 2 or 3 weeks, the shits outta my system and I've been thinking crazy suicidal shit ever since then. 

But I've always been so suicidal and depressed anyway, n no meds or therapy helps except ket. It saved my life. 
But if I keep doing that shit I'm gonna definitely die early bc I can't stop when I start..

My urinary tract feels fucked I piss a lot and my digestive is fucked from past opiate abuse. 
My body is recovering rn but it's broken down badly. 

My question to the world is, whether you are, have been an addict, or not.. Is it admissible to continue doing something you know will eventually kill you if you go too far, for too long, if you truly believe life is not worth living without it? I don't wanna drink anymore, I don't wanna do coke, I don't wanna pop a bean or a xan, all I want is to just fly away into a khole and say bye. Maybe I've dissociated so far that I don't want to come back. Being in reality is so unbearable tbh. As much as I'm running away from reality I'm also just trying to touch that rush again. Idk. 
I've been Cali sober for a few weeks now. 
I had a beer actually, but I didn't even want to drink enough to get drunk. It hurt my body to drink 2 beers more than a huge ket binge. 

Every day I work, and sleep, hoping to wake up in a better world.

1j7uuu5,1741599457.0,Had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life,"I had a really disturbing dream last night, and I feel like it carries a strong meaning. It was incredibly violent, vivid, and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout.

The dream:

I was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me, claiming that she had left her jewelry—one necklace and three rings—on my hammock. While I was still half-asleep, I found the jewelry, but she kept grabbing at me, searching for it. I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them.

Later, I ended up returning only the necklace, which was worthless, at the building’s front desk, but I kept the rings for myself. This threw me into a huge moral dilemma.

Then, I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery. When I finally went to pick it up, I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his legs completely crushed. Cars kept driving over him as if he wasn’t even there. There were two other bodies, crushed beyond recognition, one of them a child.

I was with David (my childhood best friend, a doctor) and Sophie (my best friend, one year behind me in med school). David went to help the injured. Meanwhile, Leo (a former friend I used to do reckless things with) appeared, but he only walked beside me. We greeted each other, exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on, but we didn’t actually talk.

As I walked back to my apartment, still holding the rings in my mouth, I decided to give them to the front desk guy. But when I got there, the usual porter was gone—this one was heavily tattooed, someone I didn’t recognize. Instead of taking the jewelry, he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine. He handed the rings back to me.

Then, I got home, and my “family”—but it wasn’t my real family, it was The Sopranos—walked in. Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry. I put the rings on my fingers.

But then the old woman appeared again. This time, she confronted me directly and took the rings from me.

The entire dream was extremely vivid. I felt a crushing sense of guilt, and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifying—I could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain, and I could hear the families crying in the distance.

At some point—either in this dream or another one—I also remember seeing my father. It was from a time before he was bedridden, before everything went downhill. He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer.

Context that might be relevant:

	•	I’m a (maybe recovering) polyaddict. I’m like a week totally clean from everything (ketamine and weed), maybe three weeks clean of a mild to moderate opiate habit. Coke isn’t really my thing but I had a conversation about my addiction with my roommate and can’t stop reflecting about my use ever since.

	•	David is my childhood best friend, now a doctor.

	•	Sophie is my best friend, one year behind me in med school.

	•	Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior, including drugs. For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened. For the first time, I’m considering cutting him off completely.

	•	I’m currently watching The Sopranos.



This was one of the heaviest dreams I’ve ever had, and I can’t shake the feeling that it means something important.

Immediately after I woke up I felt the urge to register it. I was calm, just felt like an uncomfortable dream, but as soon as I started reading ChatGPT’s output on its meaning I had a legit anxiety attack, I’ve had like 5 LEGIT attacks in my life and this one was textbook. Hyperventilation and a physical urge to cry even though I wasn’t feeling really emotional.

1j7nvdz,1741571942.0,Smoking/vaping is unfairly demonised when compared to alcohol consumption,"Disclaimer: the smoking I am referring to in this is only nicotine/tabbaco. Not weed or anything else you might smoke as I don’t have much experience with those things and so it’s not my place to talk about. 
And also I am mostly talking about short term effects, not long term effects as any addiction has illnesses linked to it to matter what it is (but I do mention it briefly)

So I was thinking about this cuz I’ve had some discussions with my family/friends about their opinions on me smoking/vaping to deal with stress. And I had one conversation with a family member about what is “worse”, drinking or smoking (obviously all addiction is damaging. There is nothing “worse” than another thing. It’s all about what it is and who is doing it)

In my personal opinion the negative effects of smoking and vaping are much less to that of alcohol consumption. And yet it is shunned and demonised more, especially in British culture where drinking is a huge thing. 
Both should be done in moderation. And if used lightly and safely neither are particularly destructive. 

Both can be social, or done alone. A social drinker is not much different to a social smoker. You do it around others who are also doing it. 
In both cases this is moderation and yet you’re much more likely to be given a lecture and seen differently about the smoking; Despite the fact if you consume too much alcohol you black out, vomit, can become aggressive verbally and physically, and generally speaking pose more of a threat to yourself and others. 
But if you have too many cigarettes or too many drags of a vape the most that will happen is you might get nic sick, dizzy, or faint. Which is easily cured by taking a break and sitting down (as a posed to a night of sleep and then waking up feeling like shit the whole day after)

In terms of public disturbances I also believe that alcohol is the more problematic of the two. Drunk driving, vandalism, any form of assault, violence etc. are much more of a disturbance to those around you than smoking and vaping. Yes there is a smell lingering after you’ve had a cigarette outside the bar, but this is much easier to ignore than somebody shouting and singing in the street. 

Personally, my binge drinking has been much more destructive than my addiction to vaping ever will be. I miss entire nights of my life and ruin fun social gatherings for my friends all because I can’t help just having that last shot. But I have never once forgotten something or caused emotional distress to my loved ones because I vape. 

The lasting effects of long term use for either smoking or alcohol are completely different. And in some cases yes the side effects of 20 years of smoking could be worse than that of 20 years of drinking. But in those 20 years leading up to that, which caused more harm to others and your life. Probably the drinking. 
On top of this consuming nicotine is not a depressant and can be done during the day to help calm nerves before going back to the task at hand. There is no long lasting effect, and you can return to work, school, or social gathering without disturbing anyone else. It’s ten minute of feeling calmer and refreshed

Basically, I think that it’s unfair that smoking and vaping is so looked down on and shunned when drinking happens in pretty much every home and every gathering all across the world causing many more problems in public and in homes. 
Both should be done in moderation, and neither should be done to cope with mental illness and stress. And when children and poverty is involved both can lead to neglect and abuse, as unfortunately addiction really does take over your life no matter what it is.

Let me know your thoughts, have discussions just be respectful and mindful of what other people may have or are going through. Take care of yourselves my lovelys <3

1j7jiw9,1741559245.0,Memecoin Crypto Addiction,"I blame Dave Portnoy, but it’s on me. I’ve been following him my entire adult life. I discovered Barstool when I was 20 years old. I’m now 38. I would run through a wall for this man. Has provided me entertainment for years. Seems like a down to earth, nice guy. Someone I’d grab a beer with for sure. Dog lover. Sports lover. A lot of things we have in common. Just like him, I definitely would consider myself a compulsive gambler. I’ve had run ins with problem gambling before. Mainly sports gambling, horse racing and online casinos.

Anyway, it was just another night, right before the Super Bowl. Scrolling X, I see him yapping about meme coins. I’ve never invested in crypto in my life. Didn’t even know what meme coins were. He was going nuts about Jailstool this and Jailstool that. I took a look into it and saw this coin soaring. Anything he touches turns to gold typically, I thought it’d be a quick buck, a thrill. Threw in $500 and watched it rise. First trade hit like a drug—heart slamming, palms sweaty, this insane rush I’d never felt. Started investing in other coins I knew nothing about. This was bigger than sports betting, wilder than casinos. Your money could 10x in 5 minutes or be gone in the blink of an eye. I never seen anything like it. I was alive, fucking alive, for the first time in years. Nothing’s matched it—every tick up, every X post screaming “moon,” I was all in. Started following more and more crypto “influencers”. Something about the rush and the community. Going into Twitter raids with people. Hyping up coins. Nick cannon got involved (that turned out to be a scam too). We were all in this together. Trying to hype up a coin and fill our wallets. The problem is, most people are just in it for themselves and would stab the person right next to them to make a quick buck. It’s honestly a cesspool of the grossest humans known to man. For some reason, I still can’t get enough of it. It is all I have been doing. Even at work I close my office door, listening to X spaces for the next big coin, looking at coin charts, and doing research. 

It went to shit fast (barely a month has gone by). Anyone who has been following knows Jailstool was a dud. Plummeting down non stop. All of these “influencers” are scammers. Ive quickly realized in a month that this meme crypto world is completely fixed. It’s like a casino where they know the cards before they come out. Or a sportsbook that knows the result of the game before it happens. For some reason though, this rush it is giving me, I can’t stop. I keep chasing, now down $3,500 total. Every loss was a knife, but I’d still bet more, knowing I’d lose, because that high? I craved it. Loved it. Hated myself for it. My wife—she’s everything, the only good in me. She doesn’t know. I had a terrible run in with casinos in the past. Lost way more than this. Almost lost her then—she trusted me again, and I’m shitting on that. Hiding this, sneaking around, I’m a coward and a piece of shit. She’s why I’m even here trying to get help—she’s the one lottery I’ve actually won, and I’d gamble my life away without her.  If i told her about this now it would for sure ruin her life and our marriage. 

The $3,500 although it’s a huge sting, I’m lucky that I have a good job and it’s not life changing. If I can stop now, I can move on with my life without much impact. What I’m scared of is it’s been really hard to fucking stop. I said I was going to at 1, 2, 3, now 3.5. For now, I deleted my phantom wallet (the trading platform), deleted x, got all our money into our joint account so that I can’t take any without her seeing. I’m trying to take the right steps. Heres the big problem - Without the coins, I’m empty—time with her, watching sports, TV, even the dogs I love, it’s all dull. Things I use to enjoy, they just aren’t doing it for me. I’m numb, walking dead. This morning, I sat there thinking “what if I just wasn’t here?”—haven’t felt that since my last crash years ago. Won’t do anything to hurt myself, but it’s in my head, and that’s terrifying. What if I’m stuck like this—half a man, nothing lighting me up?

The other problem I have is no one knows. There’s no one I trust that I can lean on and tell them. I need someone to hold me to this, an accountability partner—tell me I’m done, check me if I falter. I want your stories—lost big, felt this hollow, how the hell do you climb out? I want to feel happy about regular life again, feel anything. I’m begging here. Help me kill this before it kills me.  This has grabbed me harder than any sports bet, horse race, or casino run has in the past and it scares the hell out of me.

1j7nvua,1741571982.0,Coming off benzos,"Hi everyone,

I was on 8mg of Klonopin prescribed by my pdoc. I moved to a new state about four years ago and was allowed to keep my doctor because he's licensed in all 50 states. Then in December, I was told I had to get a new doctor to prescribe my medication because it's a controlled substance and the state laws were aiming on cracking down on out-of-state prescriptions for specifically opiates and benzos. 

I tried to go cold turkey and made it about three weeks. The sickest I've ever been. I did find a new doctor after I could take no more and explained what happened. She was willing to continue my medication but at a max 2mg (down from 8mg) per day. She is willing to increase it to 3mg a day at this point. 

I'm still on the 2mg for the second month and I feel rotten. Not in full-blown withdrawal like I was when I was left with nothing, but still, my quality of life is not good. 

I'm wondering what I can do to improve my mental health. We're discussing adding an anti-depressant to help the depression and she already did add Ambien for the insomnia. 

As far as I know, inpatient programs aren't great for benzos because the withdrawal timelines are long and sometimes protracted/unknown. Would a 12 step group help me? Would outpatient treatment help? Are there any OTC things that can make benzo withdrawal feel better?

I so badly want to be benzo free at this point but after 8 years at 8mg a day, I feel like my brain doesn't know how to work without medication anymore and the emotional and physical sickness from withdrawal is so terrifying that I am trying my best to avoid it. And I know ""cold turkey"" is dangerous and that I shouldn't have tried it, but when the state sprung the decision on me, I had no doctor and had to wait to see one, anyway, so I thought it might work, but it failed horribly. 

I can make it on 2 a day. A little more comfortably on 3, a little less comfortably on 1. I just want to be able to leave the house and not feel mired in ailments all the time. On 8, I felt pretty good every day, but it was so much that it was allowing me not to have to do the work to feel better, leaving me the way I am now, struggling with the same issues and not having enough medication anymore to make all ""bad feelings"" go away and not even knowing what resources could possibly help me at this point.

So if any of you has struggled with benzo withdrawal or discontinuation and came through okay, please let me know what helped you.

1j78f9v,1741529442.0,"I think I just have an addictive personality...addicted to so many things, but I don't know what to do with my time if I'm not doing these?","Here's my story, in short: 

I currently run my own business, solopreneur. It's a very successful business, and I'm thankful for that. Problem is, I get addicted to things VERY easily. I hate finding new people to sell to, but since I'm always figuring out smarter ways to do the other things in the business (read: LOTS of automation), I'm really good at freeing up my time during the day. Then when all that's left to do is to prospect, I fall into the traps of addiction. 

At first I thought all I'll need to do is just give myself more things to do during the day and then I won't feel the urge to be engaged in my addictions, and that worked...while it lasted. Once I didn't have as many things to do I just kinda relapsed. 

I also 100% use these addictions as an escape. Like when a customer sends me an angry email or when I get a large refund or when I'm having relationship issues (which I think I've since solved), I think ""omg, this is so dumb"", and then get a HUGE urge to escape.

I've been addicted to porn, YouTube, gaming, and producing music (yeah, that's a thing: when I start producing a song I get so caught up in it that I can't take my mind off of it, and even after shutting the program down I get the urge to ""just finish up that ONE part"" as soon as there's a break in the action at work or if I experience a trigger). I don't get addicted to anything in particular at any point in time, it's more just like me trying to fill up my time and escape doing the annoying stuff, so it's whatever I feel like doing.

At the moment I'm addicted to playing the Gameboy version of Pokemon, and am like halfway through and I feel the urge to go play as I write this, just to finish the game. So yeah, it's 100% a prison and I'm 100% inside it and don't know how to get out.

I'm currently listening to ""The Easy Peasy Method to Quit Porn"" on YouTube and that's been great; I'm trying to listen through once with a focus on escaping porn for good, and then I plan on going through it again with a focus on escaping gaming for good as well. 

A part of me doesn't think it's even possible for me to escape gaming, as I've been playing computer games since I was 3 or 4. But after I realized that, successful as my business was last year, I could've made SO MUCH more money and been able to buy certain things that I wanted and felt more financially stable if I didn't waste upwards of 500 working hours of the workday on these addictions (mostly spent gaming and YouTUbe last year).

1j7778v,1741525463.0,"Depressed partner seeking out substances, what should I do?","Im sorry if this is super long im just so worried and I don't know how to approach this and im scared ill lose my partner.

I (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) of 7 years are going through a rough patch, and I genuinely believe that he's going to make a life altering decision to turn to drugs while in a active depression.
Ive known my boyfriend to have depression ever since we've been together since our start of high school and I have done nothing less than support him as much as I possibly can. I have been vocally against substances because of my history growing up with abusive guardians struggling with addiction, and for a long time we'd perfectly understood that substances wouldn't be a barrier to our relationship or friendship and that serious substances are and will always be my hard line. I know the signs because it's been almost my entire life.

 Until recently, within the past 2 years he's been experimenting more with alcohol and weed, which ive slowly gotten more comfortable with but lately I've noticed that he's not just experimenting or socially partaking in it, but he's actively using alcohol and weed to cope with his severe depression and suicidal thoughts/action. Looking back on it now,  he's talked about getting high almost everyday. But it's not just that. He's showing an immense amount of interest in actual substances like designer drugs and pills. I didn't even know what that was until he told me about it so I know that he's been doing research. We talk about any and everything, so I'm grateful that he came to me when he told me that he found a website that sold a variety of substances. And that he'd been seriously considering it. Since then I feel like he's befriending the wrong people and  I've seen one of his vent accounts (that he gave me permission to see) where he's been asking for reviews on different drugs and where to get them.

I don't know what to do and I know that he isn't far gone. I talked to him about how his behaviors have worried me, what he'd be risking, that he has a support system and people that love him and will be there for him, that drugs aren't the only option for him right now. And I know he's struggling, I know that he just wants to feel better, in control, and not in so much pain. I told him that if he makes the decision to turn to drugs, I will do everything i can so that he gets the help he needs which includes me talking to his parent, and me stepping back as his romantic partner until hes accepted help. And he told me that if i do so he'll leave me, and ill never see him again. He said that if i say anything and he isnt ""on the street"", he'll leave me.But hes so unwell and so unstable right now that he doesnt know how bad his depression has really got. Hes spiraling and im slowly losing my best friend. I really do care about him and we've been together for so long,  I can't stand to see him go down the wrong path. 

I've thought about contacting his mom who has recently been more receptive towards him getting help, but that comes with a lot of risk, and im in a hard position, what do I do?

1j6wu3s,1741485058.0,My mom is 21 years sober and started ketamine therapy,"I really don’t know how to feel about this. 

I was in 8th grade when my mom uprooted her life, moved 12 hours away from me and went to treatment. That was 21 years ago and she’s been sober ever since - not a drink or a drug outside of pain killers for major surgery until now. 

Her and my step dad started the ketamine therapy awhile back to work through some deep rooted trauma they couldn’t get to via talk therapy. My step dad (20 years sober) lost his job shortly after and they continued doing it therapeutically to process everything. 

I totally get the motivation to explore different approaches to therapy, but what makes this shocking is that my parents aren’t just sober they’re like fully immersed in recovery. Their careers are both in the addiction space - clinically and educationally. And they’ve openly shown mixed feelings about people claiming to be sober while using marijuana even. I’m just shocked they’re going down this path. 

Also, I know NOTHING about ketamine. Psychedelics - yes - I’m familiar with the therapy side and don’t find them to be a concern for their addiction. But the ketamine? No freaking clue.

For those who’ve done it - sober or not - can you shed some light on this? Is this compromising their sobriety? Should I be concerned?

1j73sie,1741511355.0,Question to all the men trying to quit p,"Hey guys,

*This post was approved by mods.*

to be most upfront: I need your honest opinion for an app idea I have. Be ruthless, but be kind.

I've struggled with P addiction for quite some time in my life (starting at around 14 until around 28 - I'm 33 now).

After years of relapsing, discovering myself and increasing self-awareness enough – to the point where I was eventually able to understand why I was addicted in the first place – I was able to quit.

Unfortunately, this filth has never really left my life.

In the sense that social media is full of it and even in my friend group guys are talking about them struggling too. And the amount of people online talking about having issues with it is just astounding.

That being said:

There are sh!t ton of apps that aim at helping you quit, but I figured many of these just do the same stuff (some quotes, streak counter, badges, accountability that works more or less well) which more often than not hinders your ability to quit bc you eventually feel even more shame for breaking streak etc.

But not many apps dive into the REAL underlying issues

- psychological triggers

- dopamine addiction

- emotional reasons

And tbh, often times they're just boring to use (bad UX, no gamification).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Lately I've decided to pursue my lifelong dream of learning how to program and I thought what better way to do it than to actually build something that helps other people.

Since watching porn usually comes with a boat load of shame around it, I was thinking about what would happen if you could actually make a game out of quitting.

So, the idea is to build an RPG-game like app where people can choose different classes like warrior, mage, rogue etc that tailors to their personal preference and whenever the urges hit, they will be tasked with quests (e.g. warrior -> do 10 push ups etc), they can level the character, perform side quests and so on (think of the app Finch but for quitting P)

And for those of you who have quit or are trying to quit, you know this:

Quitting will do jack shit for you if you don't replace the free time and energy with something that actually makes your life better.

Now, obviously there's a lot more that goes into it, but the app would actually solve three problems:

- quit p

- become a better human along the way by building habits

- increase self awareness and emotional resilience along the way

-----------------------------------------------------------------

So, I guess the question is:

Would you guys actually use something like this?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

PS:

I have tryed It multiple times and with Lots of different methodes but nothing really works because It always results in seeing someone smoke or seeing cigerettes on a shelf in a store or something and me falling back at it.

Since I got off the other Things i also want to quit Smoking because i want to be 100% Clean but so far It didnt Work.

Anyone got advice or Something?

1j6wduz,1741483581.0,Please help,"I’m so fucked. I struggled with anxiety as a teenager, was prescribed 60mg of adderall a day, and Xanax to help. Of course the adderall increased anxiety and thankfully I never abused Xanax but It was the only time I felt normal.

College I realized how accessible alcohol was and i quickly became a morning/all day drinker as soon as I turned 21. I was suffering from anxiety and depression when I was sober, but obviously failed out after drinking 24/7. I was having panic attacks, couldn’t tell what dreams were real or not, etc.

Moved back home and got a job. Got sent to detox after being drunk on the job. My manager is an angel who has been through shit herself and kept me on after detox. I got 2 promotions and have done excellent in my job since then. 

I relapsed about 4 months ago - im being taken advantage from the same manager but feel like I should just deal with it since I was given a second chance. Everyone in the workplace knows I’m being taken advantage of but they don’t know our history so they don’t get why im not standing up.

I live at home and my parents won’t let me move out-they don’t trust me. They’ve shown up to the friends’ houses that im hanging out with and caused scenes to bring me home, they’ve called my work, and it’s gotten violent at home. I have bruises and im not proud of breaking my parents furniture on bad nights of my relapse when they instigate violence and i feel helpless.

I dont know what to do. My workplace is like family- they tell me to get my money together and make an exit plan.  My family tells me to quit work and they’ll help me.  The only constant in my life is a drink that will numb me and keep me totally complacent. The light is gone from my eyes at work-people can tell.  I’ve gained weight from the alcohol and lack of exercise. I don’t know who I am anymore. Something has to change but I don’t know what.

People my age are having babies, getting married, and have moved to new cities. I still live at home, have no confidence to date, and am barely surviving day to day. Please if anyone has been through something like this or has anything to say please share. Even if im in the wrong and I need a fucking reality check I’ll take anything.

1j6w92u,1741483167.0,I feel as though my little brother is going down a bad path and I’m getting worried.,"TLDR: My little brother is going down a path of substance and alcohol use, seemingly pushing away his life of aspirations, hard work, and health, to be high most of the week. Parents know he smokes weed, but don't understand to what extent. What do I do? 

My little brother (17 in january) and me 18, have a good relationship, and it has only improved over the years as a good few years back he had some problems with behaviour, which was difficult for me and my parents. He was also used by dealers to sell drugs as a kid, but he's grown up, stopped selling, become good in school, and got control over his behaviour (idk if these are important factors, but it might help to know what type of person he is). 

We drink alcohol and smoke weed from time to time, also together, but it has always been in moderation (drink 3-4 times a month and smoke no more than twice a month - usually).

That's been up until now. My brothers girlfriend of almost two years broke up with him a few weeks ago, and judging by his behaviour it has been tough on him. Whilst I have managed to get a control over my substance use, since his gf broke up with him, he's gone completely off the rails. 

Two months ago, he was interested in business, investing and wealth. He works at a firm through his school, plays soccer every week, and so on. Although we both used to use substances from time to time, and so do most other teens our age - he has suddenly started smoking multiple times a week, usually combined with drinking. It started as soon as he started smoking alone, before bed. Now it might be before school, after school, midday, you name it. A few days ago he was coming down from a high whilst we were watching TV with our dad, something I noticed, but my dad didn't. 

My parents know that he smokes weed, but I don't think they know to what extent he has started using. They obviously talk to me about this, and from what they ask me, it seems like they believe it's only every once in a while, and that the weed they found in his room (how they know he smokes in the first place), is gone because he threw it out after talking with them about the weed, excluding the fact that he literally finished it all. I just don't know if I should neglect my brothers respect for me and tell them what he is hiding behind their back, as I also know this will create confilict between my parents and my brother, which is never good. 

He has become lazier - skips work, school and other activities more often than usual. Atm, the only thing keeping him active and going is the gym and going to soccer practice constistently - which is good, but the increase of his weed and alcohol intake at his age is not only extremely damaging to his body and brain, but also to his potential to become someone, something he is aware of, but I don't think he can be bothered to think about. 

The path he is starting to go down is not great. His friends do not help either, as all of them do the same shit he does. I know he has control over what he uses, but I'm scared he will eventually move onto harder drugs, and at that point, beating addiction becomes hell. 

I've personally said all of this to him, to which he answers in a way that makes it obvious that he is in denial about his addictions, and that it's not as bad as it really is. 

Idk if I should talk to my parents about this. I'm typing this in bed as he just came home, crossfaded, and quite literally on cloud nine, even after he said a week ago he was gonna stop smoking for a while, which is worrying as it has become a usual occurance for me to have to unlock the door after midnight for my high brother.

1j6xtc3,1741488234.0,Older Brother That Has Heroin Addiction,"I've been dealing with my older brother's (48) heroin addiction ever since the Pandemic started and it all stemmed from his divorce, hanging out with his coworkers whom one of them did heroin, and losing his cabin business from both the divorce and the heroin addiction. He also got himself a DUI, MiCS, having a loaded handgun, and a felony for almost running someone off the road back in the fall of 2022.

It has gotten so bad that he blames my dad for his addiction, losing all of his money, divorce, his arrest, etc. He has also been treating me and our other brother like we're still kids and thinks he can gaslight the both of us. It's pretty much the reason my niece aka his own daughter doesn't want anything to do with him. 

I'm pretty much consider myself estranged from him at the moment but he still tries to hit me up but every time I talk to him, it's usually he wants something or belittles me. This last summer when I went up for my niece's wedding, he drove me up to the point where I had to tell him enough is enough, and he then proceeded to play the victim and make me look like the bad guy, in which I automatically could see right through him doing that. 

What I'm asking is what should I do for the times he calls me because personally, my mind has been clearer not dealing with his problems but he's still my older brother?

1j6uegs,1741477528.0,My mother who is an addict had stage 4 cervical cancer,"My mother (who is an addict) was diagnosed with Stage 4 Cervical Cancer

This is long. My mom has been a drug addict since i was 3 years old. I am
now 32.  I raised my younger siblings even though I was a kid myself. I would have to go to the grocery store and steal hamburger meat to last us a week. I cooked for us daily (my parents even ate what i made with no care of how i got the ingredients). We all lived with my grandpa in a run down trailer. He worked daily just to pay the bills. He always enabled my mom. She'd go to jail he would bail her out. She needed money because she was dope sick he handed her the money. He gave her his car, payed the bills, and anything else she needed he did for her. To cut this story short,  myself and all my siblings grew up and moved out have our own lives and our own families now.  
Well my grandpa passed March 15, 2024. Almost a year ago. 3 months later she was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer. He left her the trailer . All the bills were current and even a couple paid in advance a month or 2. My mom must think living is free because she managed to get all the utilities disconnected, hasn't paid the trailer space so they kicked her out. She doesn't have a place to live so she's been in motels. She was just approved for her ssi. She applied almost immediately after getting her diagnosis. She must of gotten back pay and she gets her money every 3rd. We won't hear from her for the 1st 5 or 6 days of the month then it's constant ""i'm hungry bring me food please"" ""i don't know where im going to stay, can you please pay for my room"". I am at my limit with her. We are an average family we work pay bills and aren't rich. I am 21 weeks pregnant which came so unexpectedly and i have. a 13 year old. My bills are not cheap. And now i need to find a bigger place and have my babies room set for when he gets here. It's the same every single morning my mother blowing us all up for money, food, adult diapers. I told her when she was released from the hospital (because she had been clean for 4 months) that if she continued on this path and continued to get her treatments i wouldn't mind her staying with me. A week later she's doped up and she stopped chemo. Idk what to do. I don't want to ignore her and then she passes away feel bad for not helping her, but at the same time she's clearly taking advantage of her condition. What would you all do if you were in my shoes!

1j6qxg7,1741467845.0,A relapse became a lesson,"Hello everyone.

I gave up alcohol 13 months ago.

I used to drink alcohol to stave off loneliness / boredom / social anxiety.

I had a relapse last weekend and this weekend.  Last weekend - social anxiety.  This week-end - habit.

What i learned.  I don't actually like alcohol and it interferes with my life. Addressing social anxiety / lonliness / boredom - it increases all of them and leaves no space to attend to them or find out what i enjoy and my goodness. 

Short post but mainly i wanted to say, 13 months on, despite relapsing, a MASSIVE THANK YOU to the people on here who reached out when i hit bottom.  You will never know how much you helped me; you changed my relationship to alcohol.  I am more grateful than you know.

1j6t76g,1741474118.0,I don't feel good anymore. I need help but don't know how to take it.,"It started with weed, The first mistake I made was be the guy in the group who knows where to get the good stuff because I didn't have supervision at home. I could smoke weed at home cool right? So I thought until I realised I'm addicted to weed. Then It was cigarettes after that my first boss at a petstore made me try some coke at 18. That went on every time I'd get paid or extra money I'd think of doing coke since she stopped giving me coke for free. So I stopped because I literally could not afford it I knew this time I was addicted but i blamed my environment, I didn't go to college but started a job where every smoked weed all the time, before shift, during shift,after shift and then again at home. I told people it's all organic don't panic it helps me sleep I was the guy who thought I am this. Like being a druggie is a personality and anyone who judges me doesn't know me. My first relationship ended because she wanted me to quit and instead she started smoking weed as well. Eventually blamed me and left. But I had stopped coke which is great. But moved to different city and unfortunately my boss put me up in a hotel where the manager dealt drugs and they literally had. Trip room. At first I again excused myself by saying you attract your tribe here I had chance for fresh start but started using Mdma or maybe it was bath salts who knows it felt good kept me dancing in the club lost weight had glow from doing it on the weekend to doing a 14 day streak was snorting just to work again at first I said to myself it's helping me I'm happy every one's happy but I was not and in debt for the first time. I moved away from the hotel after a year the damage was done I tried stopping but just needed a push to use again decided I need to leave the city and go back home atleast I don't know anyone there who doesn't anything it's all about your environment i said.
But then on new year's I met my mentor who got a contact of coke dealer i knew then in the back of mind this is bad Idea. Instead I said let's goo!!! And give me his no. Now with adult money not much but enough to by 2-3 grams i became his best customer without my mentor knowing know one knows I'm so addicted I do it many times in a month I win bets instead of paying my debts I do coke and take on more debt it's was fun before now I just do it alone silently with something on the tv. I'm going to lose my job because I didn't show up most of the times on the night I am using I think they know as well. I feel things are going to go really bad for me they aren't yet but I am scared of addiction this person writing this and the person sober tomorrow feel different and don't like each other. I sober up sometimes but come back stronger. Now my nose bleed after every use still I google alternate ways to do coke. I remember we shared a bad between us 2 now sometime 4bags are enough for me alone it's literally as much as gold per gram if spent that money on my future my mom would be so proud but her son's an addict and I dont know how to stop because I've even forgotten when was the last time I promised myself this will be my last time I've just accepted some people like are born to rot.

1j7170g,1741500244.0,I need help - relapse,"I don’t even know what happened, it’s just a blur. One moment I had 8 months clean from coke and the next I had thrown that away. I can’t keep doing this. I have been in and out of treatment for 6 years for both addiction and mental health struggles. I have been given the tools for recovery but I don’t use them. I have been helped so much but I can’t seem to apply it. I keep falling into the trap of complacency. I think everything is fine, and it is until it’s not.

At this point in my recovery journey I should have more awareness. Well it’s not even about awareness because I know what I need to do. It comes down to not caring. I think it’s not a big deal if I skip a shower or don’t journal but it is a big deal. My foundation is so cracked and falling apart. I keep trying to achieve these major life goals but I can’t even meet my basic needs. I put all my energy into these big goals and forget about the stuff that’s gonna help me get there. I need to slow the fuck down. 

Before I can do anything I need to get clean. I’ve been on a coke bender since Tuesday. I’ve done around 5 or 6g in 5 days and my nose just started bleeding. I already have a huge fucking hole there and I’m just making it so much worse. I’m keeping this a secret from everyone in my life and I feel so isolated.

1j70sgq,1741498692.0,Ketamine addiction,"Hi, i am currently a 17 year old going through an active ketamine addiction.

I started using heavily around December 2023 and it was all fun for a good few months, until I started noticing the effects on my body I never used to experience K bladder until later on into my addiction but I experienced K cramps first hand during summer of 2024.

K cramps are the worst pain I think anyone could go through. My first experience with them was I took some ketamine and ending up falling asleep I woke up around 3am and I was met with this horrible, horrible twisting spasm in my right side underneath my ribcage I was so scared since I was only 16 at the time I had woken my ex up and I was crying and begging him to help me he was very startled in the end the pains wouldn't go away so he had to wake his mum up and call an ambulance after talking to the operator I had to tell them I had ket because I was scared incase they gave me some form of medication and it didn't mix well because i weren't honest with them. The pains ended up relaxing but the operator said they still had to come because I was under 18 doing drugs.

K cramps are lethal, I am currently going through them I have had these K cramps for almost 20 hours now they never usually last this long, so its really put me off sniffing another bag for a while.

Things I do that ease my pain for people suffering with K cramps:
• Vomiting, sometimes it makes it worse sometimes it relives me full stop.

• Hot teas (peppermint/green teas)

• Hot water bottle/ Ice pack.

• Cocodamol, paracetamol, busocpan.

• Hair dryer on your stomach.

•Water (it is so bad to be dehydrated while going through K cramps)

• A fan to cool your body when you overheat and or sweating.

• Fetal position ( getting a pillow and lying on your right side helps me)

• A hot bath/ shower.

Remember, K cramps do not last forever the pain will eventually go, I know it may seem like the end of the world but try and keep a positive mindset. 
You have got this!!

K bladder.

I have only really experienced K bladder for 2 weeks.
It got to a point I was unable to walk, I was in and out of the toilet, weeing on towels because i was too exhausted to get to the bathroom.

Things to help K bladder:

• Cranberry juice (No sugar)

• Cystic powder.

• Antibiotics

• A LOT OF WATER!!!!!!!

• Fetal position 


There is not enough research on ketamine and the things it does to your body, I am trying to slowly work my way out of my addiction it is hard but I am proud of myself for trying.
This is always a safe place for people struggling with substance abuse I do believe in everyone going through it you are stronger than your cravings!!

1j6ovth,1741462248.0,Managed my first day on just benzos since being homeless in temporary accommodation,"Nearly 3 weeks back I became homeless, I had a suicide attempt and my family found out about my drug use. They were willing to let me stay at home but social services said I had to leave because I've got younger siblings (only ever used at night when they were asleep or when I was away from home, made sure to keep my drugs inaccessible to them and stay in my room so they would never see me high, I love my siblings and would never knowingly risk them witnessing me high or getting access to my drugs). Literally the day after I got discharged from hospital, I was kicked out. Spent the weekend in a hotel and on the Monday I got put in temporary accommodation. 

The thing is I've never been alone like that. I'm 20 and have always lived with my family. When I wasn't at theirs, I was either in psych wards when I was in my mid teens or over the last half year I've stayed at my mates house a lot. But I've never been alone. I'm autistic and have various other mental illnesses so I really don't do well in new places especially not alone. I managed in the hotel because I had my therapy cat with me and had to stay alert and be there for him. But completely alone in temporary accommodation (they don't allow pets) I've not coped. Every night I've been there I've been getting as high as I could. Benzos daily (I'm physically dependent on benzos so I can't not take them) with opiates or ket or DXM or whatever I can find to get me messed up. The only times I've managed on just a low benzo dose have been the nights I've been allowed to stay at home with my cat which I've only had a few of those nights so far, they've only been allowed as of recently because of how much I'm struggling to cope and how bad my mental state got. The agreement is I'm allowed 1-2 nights a week at home on the conditions that I only use my anti withdrawal benzo dose alone in my room at night, don't come home high and don't bring drugs with me aside from obviously the one dose of benzos. 

Wednesday night I wanted to try my first night in that place on nothing but my non withdrawal dose of benzos (two bars, doesn't get me high but stops me from WD). Ended up in hospital needing stitches for self injury and did ket in the A&E bathroom. Failed. But Thursday night I actually did it. Granted, a higher dose of benzos than normal but I did a night non benzo sober. I had access to multiple other drugs but I didn't touch them.

It doesn't seem like much of an achievement when I'm still using benzos every day, especially not when I used a higher dose than my anti WD so I did still get a high but for me it's a step in the right direction. And I'm going to keep trying over time to manage more and more nights in that place on just the benzos, hopefully in lower doses as time goes on. 

Might not be able to get completely sober yet but I'm going to try and put the work in to reduce how much I'm using and reduce how often I'm mixing potentially dangerous and fatal drugs. I want to get better and I'm going to keep putting the effort in until I get a space in detox and rehab. Hopefully by then I'll have reduced even more.

1j6mnkq,1741456335.0,Delusions Of Grandeur: reading this will make you see how crazy you arent.,"I understand finding a higher power is the key most have found to solving the disease of the mind we call addiction. 
I have developed a pretty bulletproof holier than thou complex, and being so aware yet still choosing to feel my loops of thought and hatred all the more frustrating. 
at times i feel like i am going insane, i have thoughts of “these people arent like me” and somehow i am better and more aware than they are. I used to tell myself im humble but im starting to believe appearing as a humble person to others was the only reason i wanted to be so humble and self aware. 
what i struggle with is thinking. every second of every day i think. theres a little voice in my head telling me how to act, what to think, and how to make situations go my way. In truth i see myself as some sort of master manipulator and have become prideful of that discusting “fact”. 
“I went to rehab and all i got was this lousy tee shirt” 
rehab made me realise im not alone, but that feeling of normality and saneness can only come from me truly believing it, and practicing “self love” i suppose is the term. 
I think about what I am thinking, I disect everything that voice in my head says just to try to answer questions I know i cant solve. I need more people around me to feel comfortable, I am truthfully a social person. but the voice comes back. is it all just a manipulative plot i create and dont even realise? am I even real anymore? how do i get over this when people that talk this way are considered crazy. people seem to care when its convenient for them. So i should start caring about myself without reling on the attention of others so often. But yet i continue to snort cocaine and lose my shit. im delusional and self aware of the delusions which causes me to create more delusions in my head to feel normal. self pity and selfish ways for what? i have such love for other people yet only seem to care about how they make me feel. Even going out of my way to “help” others just to feel like more of a god. Im starting to think im losing it or everyone else is. Im not crazy you are type stuff. Back to rehab seems to be the only option. back to the cult of god and loving eachother. i really love it but despise my reliance on it. a fellowship of people like me. I love me so I love people I see myself in. So fucking gross. Me Me Me all day. even typing this long ass message is just a way for me to keep myself in the loop of me. shit is pathetic. self pity gotta love it. this shit is so lame idk if anyone is reading this but if someone is and is struggling too, you arent crazy. you just keep being so disrespectful and hard on yourself that you are losing your grip on who you are. and drugs are only going to add to the delusion of control over these thoughts. shit is the devil man. real shi",4,3,/r/addiction/comments/1j6mnkq/delusions_of_grandeur_reading_this_will_make_you/,understand finding higher power key found solving disease mind call addiction developed pretty bulletproof holier thou complex aware yet still choosing feel loops thought hatred frustrating times feel like going insane thoughts people arent like somehow better aware used tell im humble im starting believe appearing humble person others reason wanted humble self aware struggle thinking every second every day think theres little voice head telling act think make situations go way truth see sort master manipulator become prideful discusting fact went rehab got lousy tee shirt rehab made realise im alone feeling normality saneness come truly believing practicing self love suppose term think thinking disect everything voice head says try answer questions know cant solve need people around feel comfortable truthfully social person voice comes back manipulative plot create dont even realise even real anymore get people talk way considered crazy people seem care convenient start caring without reling attention others often yet continue snort cocaine lose shit im delusional self aware delusions causes create delusions head feel normal self pity selfish ways love people yet seem care make feel even going way help others feel like god im starting think im losing everyone else im crazy type stuff back rehab seems option back cult god loving eachother really love despise reliance fellowship people like love love people see fucking gross day even typing long ass message way keep loop shit pathetic self pity got ta love shit lame idk anyone reading someone struggling arent crazy keep disrespectful hard losing grip drugs going add delusion control thoughts shit devil man real shi
1j6az9x,1741414734.0,"Today I accepted the fact that I am addicted to cocaine, and I fucking hate myself.","This is gonna be a long post. I have literally nowhere else to put my words though, none of my family or friends (besides the 1 friend who has occasionally done it with me, but to their knowledge does not know that I do it on my own constantly) know that I do cocaine almost daily and it is eating me alive.

It started out how it ‘usually does’ - few bumps maybe every couple of months or longer during special occasions, then a couple of months turned into every other weekend, especially when drinks were involved, to every other day after I got robbed in a city I’ve never been in before that set me off into the worst bipolar depressive episode I have ever had. 

I was doing SO fucking good before too. I had all of my bipolar meds that kept me steady, I became addicted to the gym and working out daily for hours straight, rarely drank alcohol - I looked fucking great too (because I was healthy lol) Then I decided to go to a music festival in a city 8 hours away that I have never been to before; my first solo trip… and then I got fucking robbed. All of my ID’s stolen (which sucked immensely because I drove there so the drive home was risky) and my credit card as well. I slept in a Denny’s parking lot for 3 hours to sober up off the few drinks I had in the festival and then drove home sobbing and feeling like a complete idiot. 

I don’t even really think it was the whole robbed thing that set off this horrid episode because when you have Bipolar, you know that what goes up absolutely comes crashing fucking down. I knew I was gonna crash, this robbing situation just accelerated it. 

I got super fucking depressed and suicidal, had an attempt on my own goddamn Bipolar medications - which led the hospital to completely cold turkey me off of every single one without the help of a psychiatrist (as he was on vacation during the time lol). To COLD TURKEY off of fucking anything that changes your brain’s chemicals is absolutely ass, I have absolutely never felt this way in my entire life. I literally feel like my soul left that day but my body is still here. Time doesn’t feel real - it’s Monday and then I lay in bed all day and suddenly it’s 3 fucking Mondays later. Literally everything is out of wack in my system, STILL. This robbing incident took place in July, it’s 8 months later and i’m still in this fucking depressive episode and on top of it, I forced my own self to confess that I have a pathetic issue with cocaine. 

I had enrolled in college and started in the end of September, but by this point I was so fucked up from the cold turkey meds situation that sleep was nonexistent to the point I was seeing shit and became super paranoid. I could barely wake up everyday for my 9 AM classes and even when I did, I would fall asleep during the entire class (can sleep anywhere else but in my own bed when I’m supposed to, I guess?) So I bought a bag of cocaine.

At first it was GREAT, I was able to go to class alert and actually participate in my course discussions, I didn’t feel so much anxiety while socializing in my class, and it didn’t matter if I was running on no sleep - I was awake. ‘I’ was in control of myself for the first time in months - no longer wasting the day in bed not knowing what time or actual day it was being a complete hermit. I was actually able to function. But then of course, it started to suck. Obviously coke fucks with your sleep and I already wasn’t sleeping, so I found myself bumping lines at 7 AM daily (even if there wasn’t class, just so I could get that alert, non-depressive fatigue feeling and clean my house fully, go to the grocery store, etc) all the way until 7 AM the next day. 

*It has been 6 months of this and I completely fucking hate myself.*

I don’t do it every single day, sometimes 2 days in a row, pause for 1 and then back again or 3 days without any and then the rest of the week I am a coked out loser. 

I am a VERY functional addict but obviously everyone could see a change in me, essentially rapid cycling through different emotions every single day (really depressed and quiet to happy and outgoing) but for the last few months, I haven’t been able to get that outgoing happy feeling from it, I just feel sad and anxious and I keep thinking of how fucking stupid I am. And how gross coke is. And how I am a ‘coke head’. 

I’m hermit-ting again and everyone notices but they just assume it is my Bipolar. I just don’t feel like myself enough to be around everyone else. I haven’t felt like myself in 8 months. It has actually been really interesting because throughout the period of doing coke constantly, I have noticed changes in myself behaviour and appearance wise and have thought of myself as some sort of fucked up science experiment. I have actually really fucked up my health too, which continuously weighs on me because there is nothing and nobody else to blame it on but me, because I do a very gross and depressing habit. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking much. I hate that i’m too ashamed of myself to be around anyone because of my actions yet *why haven’t I stopped then?* because you are a fucking addict. I hate that I’ve been missing appointments and repeatedly having to do apology tours and lie about being really sick as the reason for missing them, when really I missed those appointments because I stayed up for 13 hours straight with my nose in a bag and then needed to sleep, thus missing the appointment. I hate how I fucking look, my hair is thin and sad looking and my skin that was once a beautiful deep tan olive tone has turned grey and dry - *dead looking*. I hate how I feel every time I wake up the next day with a stuffed up nose. I hate thinking about how much of a fucking pathetic loser I was the night before when looking for cocaine remnants in my carpet - like holy fuck, what is wrong with you???

It sucks because I am SO hyper aware of what I am doing to myself and I just sit there and crush myself over and over again, only to do the same thing the next day and then mentally berate myself for being an absolute moron. The concept of it is so simple, just stop doing cocaine - yet it is so confusing because I actually don’t even know why I keep doing it.

I do not get withdrawal symptoms, granted I only give myself a week of a break off of the drug, but I do not have any *physical* addiction symptoms, just mental. If that even makes sense. I can go days without it, but the moment I see it in a TV show, or see a meme about drugs, then I want to do it and I do it. Maybe that is physically addicted, I don’t know. Probably. It’s just that I have no fucking reason to actually do it, physical-ly wise. Yes I am really, really sad but I don’t need it and I know that. 

Today I have decided this is where this fucking ends because for 6 MONTHS I have not been alive. I plan on going back to the gym and dedicating my time to that, no longer going out or drinking alcohol since that seems to always lead to one thing to the next, focusing on school, taking care of myself because I have SEVERALLY neglected myself during these few months, and just being a normal fucking human being again. 

I just hate this shame and guilt that I constantly have and it’s not coming from anyone else but myself and I think that is almost worse. I am keeping my own deepest darkest secret that is destroying me. I am so ashamed, disappointed, angry, and saddened by myself. Why do I hate myself so much and feel so much pain that this is what I have done to myself? 

Fuck cocaine. Fuck being a zombie. Today I am sober and I plan on living my life out that way.

1j6i4zb,1741443619.0,How can I help my brother/what can I do?,"Couldn't figure out what to flair. 

I got to know he was using heroin regularly last year. Since then he has said he's stopped. We're not too close so we don't talk much. 

But he's told me he has tried all sorts of drugs like coke/meth etc. He told me he snorted and smoked meth. He told me his friends are all into this lifestyle. He's injected people with heroin. 

Full disclosure, I smoke weed. But that's all. I was smoking with him when he told me all this. He's also selling people weed and is friends with a dealer. He told me he delegates for the dealer. 

I'm not judging at all. But I think this is a dangerous path and a slippery slope. I asked him if he'll ever stop being in lifestyle and he said someday when he feels he needs to stop. 

I'm trying to be very careful because this is the first time he's opened up. I'm worried about him and I don't have any experience with any of this so I don't know what's going on. I asked him if he'd consider rehab and he told me a lot of people he knows about who's gone to rehab, come out and started using double the amount they were doing before. 

I have done some research. I know I can't force him to stop anything. It'll only happen when he would want to himself. I can't tell anyone in my family.

1j68vuf,1741407012.0,How do I go about getting clean when my body craves weed,"M(19), I have been smoking pot for a while now, I started when I was 14, daily use since with two-month-long t-breaks. I am currently finishing my second year at college and my life just seems to be falling apart. 

My addiction has always been rampant in my life, I have no backbone when it comes to the cravings.  I dream of the life I could have without weed, but nothing in me stops me from smoking, and when I do, it's a short-lived rebellion. 

I have no one to talk to, my friends downplay the effects of weed, and I am out of therapy due to time constraints. I also have a girlfriend, she is three years clean of weed, she understands me and comforts me, but I feel so much guilt every time I smoke. She understands the addiction, but I can't bring myself to tell her that I am high almost 24/7. She has clocked it a few times and she becomes saddened by my lack of openness. She is most hurt by her inability to help me, because she knows how much this weighs on me, but even with all of this, I still smoke.

My body craves the need to fill every inch of ""free time"" with a high. I can't take it anymore, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've also begun to notice memory failure, and it honestly came out of nowhere. I am having horrible insomnia, the thought of eating food makes me want to puke, I can't enjoy music like I used to, I can't seem to find the motivation to push myself in the gym, and overall my mental health has deteriorated into oblivion. 

I haven't had a dream in so long, I miss my imagination, I feel like a hole has been cut out of my brain, I resent my life choices nowadays, and I just don't feel like the same person. I am 19 years old, but I look like I'm 30. My hair is unkept, I live in the wasteland known as my room, and I eat like a prevent woman. 

I just want help to figure out how I approach overcoming an addiction that scratches at the back of my brain.

1j66dj9,1741398758.0,Research Studying Experiences in Emergency Departments,"Hello, 

I hope you are doing well. My name is Raymond Yu, and I’m a student at Binghamton University- State University of New York.

I’m currently conducting research on the effects of stigma on Mental Health Concerns and its Impact on Patient’s Perception of the Quality of Care in the Emergency Department. I’m looking for participants that are at least 18 years old and have reported to the emergency department with mental health complaints to complete a short survey online. There is no direct monetary compensation for participating in this research. 

Unfortunately there is a shared negative experience of the quality of care provided in the Emergency Department- especially for those that are seeking mental health care. Although there are many factors, research has shown that stigma has impacted the way healthcare providers perceive and care for individuals in need of psychiatric care. However, there are very little research studies that highlight the voices of patients and their perception on how stigma has impacted their experience and care in the emergency department. I’m hoping that my research will help us better understand the impacts of stigma on healthcare delivery in the emergency department, and be used to better services for future patients. 

I understand that research studies- particularly those that involve individuals with mental health concerns- are often viewed negatively due to historical instances of unethical practices, stigmatization, and potential harm to participants. However, I am hopeful that my research can be used to reduce stigmatization and improve the quality of care in the emergency department. I am committed to carrying out my research in the most ethical way possible, and plan on sharing my findings with you all.

I truly believe many of you have valuable experiences and stories to share. I’m hoping you will consider sharing your input, as it could have a huge impact on our findings and potentially change how mental health care is delivered, not just in the emergency department, but across the healthcare system as a whole. Your voices matter and can truly make a difference. 

No identifying information such as name, address, date of birth- will be collected in the survey. I have attached the survey link below as well as the Binghamton University’s IRB approval. 

Furthermore, if you would like to be interviewed regarding your experience, please don’t hesitate to contact us through email! However, this is not mandatory and is not required to participate in the survey. 

Regardless if you participate or not, I will share my findings from my research with you all here once it is completed. 

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me- either through responding to my message- or email at ryu19@binghamton.edu. Please also feel free to contact my faculty advisor, Alexandra Maris PhD at amaris@binghamton.edu. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I truly appreciate it. 

Wishing you all the best, 

Raymond Yu

But the problem is, 
I got injured and had a bedrest for 3 weeks. I literally had nothing to do, and hence gave into alcohol.

Now I've relapsed, drinking 4-5 times a week.

I’ve been 11 months clean now and I’ve made progress but last Friday my mom suddenly her heart stopped. My brother gave her cpr and the EMT’s used this machine that helped my mom but probably broke every single rib she has. I’m the youngest and don’t drive currently. I’ve been staying overnight at the hospital since Saturday. Getting maybe 1-3 hours of sleep a day max. Currently I’m about to sleep for hopefully 4 hours in a sec to get back to my mom. She’s doing way better but has a long recovery ahead. I’ve been taking my suboxone but getting almost no sleep and seeing them give my mom Roxycodone, morphine, fentynal, and dilaudid just kills me and gets to me. I don’t want to relapse and my mom told me she’s proud of me and she’s only going along with staying alive cause she said if I can get clean and sober after everything I’ve gone through in my life. Then she can stay on earth longer for me. Life just doesn’t feel fair or even real right now. I have to help my mom do a lot of things and I do them. I have to hear my mom cry in pain when she gets up to use the bathroom or just move around in general. She had surgery and she only did it for me and my brothers. She was so out of it at the time she told us she trusts our judgment because she wasn’t able to give consent to do the surgery because she was on so many drugs and had maybe 2 hours of sleep in about 3 days.

1javjj9,1741925627.0,"I feel like I should be happy, but I’m not","I’m a 22M, in my last year of college. I don’t think I have a single reason to keep living other than “my mom will be sad”. My last relationship was 3 years ago, and I don’t think my friends would care too much if I just disappeared - we’re not that close anyway.

I’m not happy at all. Maybe it’s because I’m job hunting right now (in software industry, so a bit tough right now). I have never enjoyed my major - I got into it for the money, and the money is pretty good to be fair. I’ve felt pretty anxious every time I job searched, but this time is the worst by far. I didn’t get the return offer from an internship I worked my ass off in, and my current internship just had layoffs and a hiring freeze. I’m an anxious person, and I feel like that doubled my anxiety. And my worry is that I would keep feeling like this even after I find a job.

I’ve always had a problem with comparing myself with others. It feels like everyone is ahead of me. I tried so hard, but every night I’m thinking “why is nothing working out for me?”. I see all my friends with great jobs, and everyone on LinkedIn getting positions that I would love to have. I also see a lot of people my age born into retirement money or getting lucky / grinding something for a few years to become rich and retire. I know everyone wants this, but I don’t even want to work, I just want to retire. The thought of working another 40 years for no reason dreads me. I even thought of gambling my savings and just dying if it didn’t work out. I’ve tried so hard, even paid for therapy out of my own pocket to stop myself from comparing myself to others but I can’t seem to get rid of this trait of mine.

But I feel like I should be happy. I have a loving family. I grew up in a decently wealthy family and I have a pretty good amount saved up from my internships, probably top 5% in my age group. There are so many people that have it much worse than me, and I feel like there is no reason for me to feel this sad. But I do.

I’m breaking down several times per day crying. Everytime I see my family I want to cry, and I avoid them everytime I get teary eyed. I don’t want my family to worry because of me. Once my mom told me not to stress too much and that everything will be okay, and I almost broke down crying on the spot. I can’t fall asleep without edibles. I think I had my first anxiety attack today, and I’m losing my ability to focus every day. I’m going to bomb my few interviews that I managed to get at this rate, and I know I’d feel even worse if that happened. I know what I have to do. Just lock in for a few months to grind out for a job, but I just can’t seem to do it.

I know there are issues with my personality. I have trouble making friends anywhere and always feel like an outsider. I think I’m on the autism spectrum, and maybe slightly sociopathic as well. I hate the anxious and depressed trait of mine. I think all this is inherited from my parents - my dad suffers from the same anxiety (i think), and both my parents are slightly sociopathic and always outsiders. I don’t want kids simply because I’m worried my child will have to go through the same life that I am living right now.

Why am I so unhappy? When will I find happiness? Why should I keep living? What is my purpose? I know I’m supposed to be still young, but I feel like I have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to.",7,2,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1javjj9/i_feel_like_i_should_be_happy_but_im_not/,im last year college dont think single reason keep living mom sad last relationship years ago dont think friends would care much disappeared close anyway im happy maybe im job hunting right software industry bit tough right never enjoyed major got money money pretty good fair ive felt pretty anxious every time job searched time worst far didnt get return offer internship worked ass current internship layoffs hiring freeze im anxious person feel like doubled anxiety worry would keep feeling like even find job ive always problem comparing others feels like everyone ahead tried hard every night im thinking nothing working see friends great jobs everyone linkedin getting positions would love also see lot people age born retirement money getting lucky grinding something years become rich retire know everyone wants dont even want work want retire thought working another years reason dreads even thought gambling savings dying didnt work ive tried hard even paid therapy pocket stop comparing others cant seem get rid trait mine feel like happy loving family grew decently wealthy family pretty good amount saved internships probably top age group many people much worse feel like reason feel sad im breaking several times per day crying everytime see family want cry avoid everytime get teary eyed dont want family worry mom told stress much everything okay almost broke crying spot cant fall asleep without edibles think first anxiety attack today im losing ability focus every day im going bomb interviews managed get rate know id feel even worse happened know lock months grind job cant seem know issues personality trouble making friends anywhere always feel like outsider think im autism spectrum maybe slightly sociopathic well hate anxious depressed trait mine think inherited parents dad suffers anxiety think parents slightly sociopathic always outsiders dont want kids simply im worried child go life living right unhappy find happiness keep living purpose know im supposed still young feel like nothing live nothing look forward

I'm a college student, at a critical juncture of my life, having to prepare and sit for exams for my higher studies. In the meantime, things in my family aren't going very well. My parents have been feuding for the past 3 months for mistakes my father had made. It hurts seeing my mother in so much pain, while I can't do anything about it. (Mind you the kind of society I live in, divorce is seen as a bad thing, and my mother is gonna suffer more afterwards if she goes that way). I'm doing everything I can to support her, knowing it's all in vain. We've always been struggling financially ever since I was born, but at least there was some peace. There was love between us. Not anymore. My house hasn't felt like home in months.

I have a lovely girlfriend. I've been dating her for about a year now, she has brought me nothing but calm, peace, and joy. I had a really toxic and manipulative Ex before her, and I had never known love could feel like this. We're both the same age, both in the same situation, giving exams, as we both have the same goal. She suffers from chronic anxiety. We've given 2 exams and the 3rd one coming later this month, and she hasn't really done well in the first two. And that's expected, given none of us prepared for that much. I did decent, I had a thorough understanding of the subjects, but so did she. Here comes the sad part. She gets so harsh with herself, constantly calling herself names, like dumb, stupid, worthless and what not. When in reality a lot of the mistakes she had made were evidently from performance anxiety, not being confident enough to even attempt questions. She has been giving mock exams for the 3rd one coming this month, really studying for it too, but she is getting more and more demoralised from the mock results, to the point I had to tell her to stop doing them. Recently it has gone so much worse, as she tells me she's gonna end her life after this exam goes south too. She says she is tired of living like a failure, like a burden to her parents who have high expectations from her. In reality, she's the kind of person every parent would want as their daughter. She's the kindest soul on the planet. I told her that I am gonna text her mother about it, but she has blocked my number from her's. Education and these exams are really important in our country too.

I've tried everything. I've told her life doesn't stop at an exam going wrong, it's never worth it, but I also understand and can see the kind of pain she's in. She's suffering so much and I can't do anything about it. She's working really hard, she always does, but something messes with the exams right at the moment, which I suspect is the anxiety. She says she sometimes goes blank when seeing questions, and she really really works too hard. Which makes the pain even worse for her. I've tried everything, told her everything she might need to hear. She already seems to have made her decision.

I myself have dealt with exam failure and suicidal tendencies in the past, though I'm doing better now. But I too, often feel like it'd be really great if something happens and I go down peacefully. Like in my sleep or something. I will not do anything to myself as I don't want to put that burden on the people around me. But sometimes I feel like it'd be a lot easier if it all stopped. I'm sleeping for the most of my day, staying awake feels like dragging myself across a desert. I'm exhausted.

I really want to help her but I don't know how. I wish I could turn back time and fix whatever the fuck is wrong with my family but I can't do that. I am stuck. I am doing fine by myself. Everything would be fine if I knew how to help my girl. I am doing my best for my mother. It's easier cuz I live with my parents. Not easier with my girlfriend, cuz we haven't been dating for long and I'm not introduced to her parents yet. Both of our mothers know about our relationship and that's it. I wish I could just go inside her head and kill all the self hatred she holds towards her. It's killing her. And seeing her in such pain is killing me too. She's an absolute blessing of a human being. She doesn't deserve to go through that.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jaz3mw/everything_seems_to_be_going_bad_and_theres/,please ignore errors writing english first language im college student critical juncture life prepare sit exams higher studies meantime things family arent going well parents feuding past months mistakes father made hurts seeing mother much pain cant anything mind kind society live divorce seen bad thing mother gon na suffer afterwards goes way im everything support knowing vain weve always struggling financially ever since born least peace love us anymore house hasnt felt like home months lovely girlfriend ive dating year brought nothing calm peace joy really toxic manipulative ex never known love could feel like age situation giving exams goal suffers chronic anxiety weve given exams rd one coming later month hasnt really done well first two thats expected given none us prepared much decent thorough understanding subjects comes sad part gets harsh constantly calling names like dumb stupid worthless reality lot mistakes made evidently performance anxiety confident enough even attempt questions giving mock exams rd one coming month really studying getting demoralised mock results point tell stop recently gone much worse tells shes gon na end life exam goes south says tired living like failure like burden parents high expectations reality shes kind person every parent would want daughter shes kindest soul planet told gon na text mother blocked number education exams really important country ive tried everything ive told life doesnt stop exam going wrong never worth also understand see kind pain shes shes suffering much cant anything shes working really hard always something messes exams right moment suspect anxiety says sometimes goes blank seeing questions really really works hard makes pain even worse ive tried everything told everything might need hear already seems made decision dealt exam failure suicidal tendencies past though im better often feel like itd really great something happens go peacefully like sleep something anything dont want put burden people around sometimes feel like itd lot easier stopped im sleeping day staying awake feels like dragging across desert im exhausted really want help dont know wish could turn back time fix whatever fuck wrong family cant stuck fine everything would fine knew help girl best mother easier cuz live parents easier girlfriend cuz havent dating long im introduced parents yet mothers know relationship thats wish could go inside head kill self hatred holds towards killing seeing pain killing shes absolute blessing human doesnt deserve go
1jas9cz,1741915076.0,Deleted a Reddit post I made due to criticism,"Hi everyone, I know this is a little dumb compared to everyone else's struggles here, but something happened to me today that made me feel down, sad, and hesistant to make any more posts on Reddit. Long story short, I found this quarter today that had two animals (bats) on the back of it, and I thought it was really cool since I've never seen a quarter with that design engraved into it before. It also had ""national park"" written on it, so I thought it would spark some fun discussion about national park quarters. I was excited to show it off and I thought this would be a cool thing to post on r/mildlyinteresting. Well... I guess I was wrong, because most of the comments I got were met with ""I guess we're posting things like quarters that have anything but an eagle on the back now,"" and ""this isn't even remotely interesting, let alone mildly."" I even got some strangely mean-spirited comments telling me I was late to the party, and then they went on some kind of rant about people making up conspiracy theories related to quarters (as if I was one of those people, I guess)? All because I posted this quarter with a different animal on it. 

I have social anxiety as is, and I know it's stupid to care about what Internet strangers say, but now I feel like such an easily impressed moron who should never post anything that she thinks is cool because she'll get criticized. I've since deleted the post and I'm never going to post on that sub again, but I just don't understand how people can be so strangely judgmental over something so innocuous. Am I the stupid one, though, for thinking it was interesting? Was I wrong for sharing it? I was excited about it before, but now I feel sad when I look at the photo I took, and I might just delete it now because it's now associated with bad memories.

1jawxil,1741931029.0,How do I stopped myself from crying when I'm trying to explain something to my parents,"I am 17yrs old almost 18 and My parents are very supportive people. They're the type to say as long as you did your best on the test thats good enough. but I don't know why everytime when I try to explain something (they don't understand) to them, tears just started forming. I just feel frustrated that they they don't understand my explanation (maybe because I'm impatient and suck at explaining) I always told myself "" next time, I shouldn't cry becuase I'm just explaining something to them that they don't understand. What is there to cry about?"" I also don't know what's  the reason for my tears but when that next time came, my tears just dropped so much. I feel like whenever I try to explain myself, explain my pov, explaining the reason why I decided to do something I get frustrated that they don't seem to understand me. They're supportive but from my pov, they're not the most empathetic people. I think this mostly happens when I'm with my dad. My dad is someone that does almost everything in our family. Cooking, manage taxes, make sure our prepare lunches for me and my brother, dinner. He helped out a lot around the house. So whenever I try to explain something to him and I cry, I feel really guilty because I feel like he doesn't deserve this treatment (where everytime when I talk to him I feel like crying) I think it's because when he and my mom argues it's really scary to hear his raised voice. But I can't help it i just feel frustrated that he doesn't understand me. That he doesn't understand my situation or try to put himself in my shoes.

As you probably know now I am a very sensitive person. I feel like I cry at every little thing. There are a few times whenever I cry in front of my dad he say to me ""how will you survive in this world if you always cry whenever someone talks to you"" I also question that myself. How can I survive in this world if I am this sensitive. 

What i wish to know are the ways to stop myself from crying when trying to explain or stop myself from crying when someone lectures me, points out my mistakes. I tried to breathing techniques they dont work at all. I tried stepping out of room and calm myself down first but before I can do that tears formed. And even if I calmed myself down when I try again, I just cry again. How will I survive university? How will I survive at jobs?

In conclusion I just have a hard time explaining myself because everytime I do i just cry. I can't even finish my explanation. I think this just happens to me when I face my teachers and my parents. 

Sorry for those that are reading this, it's a bit long. But I would really appreciate if you give me some advice so I can improve myself.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jawxil/how_do_i_stopped_myself_from_crying_when_im/,yrs old almost parents supportive people theyre type say long best test thats good enough dont know everytime try explain something dont understand tears started forming feel frustrated dont understand explanation maybe im impatient suck explaining always told next time shouldnt cry becuase im explaining something dont understand cry also dont know whats reason tears next time came tears dropped much feel like whenever try explain explain pov explaining reason decided something get frustrated dont seem understand theyre supportive pov theyre empathetic people think mostly happens im dad dad someone almost everything family cooking manage taxes make sure prepare lunches brother dinner helped lot around house whenever try explain something cry feel really guilty feel like doesnt deserve treatment everytime talk feel like crying think mom argues really scary hear raised voice cant help feel frustrated doesnt understand doesnt understand situation try put shoes probably know sensitive person feel like cry every little thing times whenever cry front dad say survive world always cry whenever someone talks also question survive world sensitive wish know ways stop crying trying explain stop crying someone lectures points mistakes tried breathing techniques dont work tried stepping room calm first tears formed even calmed try cry survive university survive jobs conclusion hard time explaining everytime cry cant even finish explanation think happens face teachers parents sorry reading bit long would really appreciate give advice improve
1jawd8o,1741928684.0,I think something might be fundamentally wrong with me?,"(Throwaway account so my friends and family dont find this, not because I don't want them to, i just need an unbiased take from people who dont know me. )


I (21 M) have some mental heath issues, the normal depression, anxiety, a bit of complex ptsd from a not so nice upbringing, maybe a drinking problem. 

Standard stuff. 

Nothing too crazy, perfectly treatable right? 
But the issue is that when I actually try and get help of any kind, like when i go out of my way to to talk to a mental health professional or a doctor I get this mental block thing that stops me saying anything important and then If I try and push past it I feel nauseous?? 

For example I was talking to a trauma councillor over lock down because a social worker referred me to them and every session I tried to bring up important information to them about how I was doing but all that I could actually get out was that I was fine other than I was a bit down and wanted to go out, but I was doing horribly, my mental state was atrocious, my routine was in shambles, i was failing school and I wanted to be dead and they where exactly who i should have told, I was theoretically able to get help but i couldn't.

When I try and focus on specific things that happened it's like it's all out of reach, I get messed up by something someone says or does and burst out crying or shut down but then if someone asks about it I cant seem to even realise what did it or what happened. It's like there's a brick wall between me and how I was feeling five minutes ago and if I try to remember I just feel sick and shaky. Even writing this I can feel my chest tightening and it's the same when I try talking to my friends. I have no idea what is wrong with me and I can't get help because when I try I can't talk about the problem and I look like I'm exaggerating how bad I'm feeling. If anyone has any advice is really appreciate it because I feel like I'm actually going insane.

Tldr: 
When I am in the presence of someone who can help me with my issues I have a mental block that stops me being able to talk to them about my issues and is having a serious impact on my life, does anyone have advice?

1jat5mm,1741917827.0,Constant Hobby Bouncing Is Ruining My Relationship,"Hi, all. I'm a 33 year old woman. Up until a year or two ago, I really didn't have any interests outside of reading, playing video games, and watching TV. I work, but never really gave it my all. Basically if it wasn't super interesting, I couldn't care less. Mingle in with this that the things I was SUPPOSED to do, I'd always do them half-way if I did them at all. A little over a year ago though, I went to a regular medical doctor and made a joke about never remembering anything because I HAVE to make a reminder on my phone for anything or it didn't happen, and she asked me a number of questions. At that point, she diagnosed me with ADHD and a binge eating disorder (which is definitely true) and prescribed me Vyvanse. My significant other thinks I should see a psychiatrist to prove I actually have ADHD, but honestly that's not the main problem. For the past year or two, it's like I pick something and I want to do it CONSTANTLY. Then, I basically shut down every other aspect of my life, focus completely on that one thing, get tired of it, set it aside, and two weeks later it's something else. Before it was crocheting, then it was diamond painting, and right now, it's making customizable trading cards and bookmarks and such (again reading is the one hobby I've never put down, basically since I learned how to read I've been reading). My boyfriend owns a business and I work there. He's been coming into work in the morning and seeing little scraps of paper all over the place from where I'm trying to learn how to make everything properly sized and such, and then scrap paper that I printed and messed up that I'm just using as an in-between layer now to add thickness to cards/not totally waste all of the paper. He's at his wits end. He thinks I'm either depressed or just generally unhappy with my life and that's why I'm like this, but for the most part I feel fairly happy. I have always kind of been the type of person that felt like I wasn't much of anything but wanted to be, if that makes sense, but haven't actually put the effort into being those things. Idk what's wrong with me. My boyfriend has put up with my shortcomings for sixteen years, and of course I don't want to lose him, and I don't want to upset him either, as he has his own health issues that really require him to stay calm as much as he can. Should I seek therapy? Am I just beyond broken? I feel lost, and worthless, and stupid.

1jaswvd,1741917072.0,i don’t know what’s wrong with me,"okay so i’m an 18 year old college student and literally my mental state has been on a DECLINE. literally i have been so depressed for the past year now but it’s been terrible the past couple months now, it’s to the point where i go days without leaving my dorm, doing work, or showering. i keep canceling plans with my friends because it’s so hard to get out of bed now. it’s also gotten to the point where ive deactivated most of my social media accounts, turn off my location, and ghosted a lot of my friends 

i can’t even bare to look at myself in the mirror without seeing so much disgust, it doesn’t help that my family has started commenting on my weight EVERYTIME they see me, deadass why did my moms bf stop me in the middle of getting ready and tell me i’m getting “ ridiculously big” and im not going to get it off no time soon?? and my mom is sitting there looking fucking stupid giggling??? it doesn’t help that i’ve been struggling with an ed

i’m home for spring break now and it’s like everything has gotten worse. i have a bf and i love him so much and we’ve been together for a year now and he’s so patient with me, but my mood is so out of whack that i can snap in second. like we would be all happy and then out of nowhere i start breaking down sobbing, or just snap at him for the tiniest things ever, and he’s been there for me through it all but he doesn’t deserve this at all. he’s the sweetest person ever and i hate when i all of a sudden snap at him and i always apologize when i realized what ive done and then i start sobbing uncontrollably because i feel bad and get scared that he doesn’t love me anymore.

i swear im trying to get better but it’s so hard to get help. especially since ive been seeing things recently. like i’ve almost crashed 3 times this week because i would be driving and then i see something in the middle of the road and swerve off the road and it’s happening even more now. or i would be chilling and then i feel things crawling on me but nothing is there at all. and it’s fucking terrifying, and it doesn’t help that i keep hearing things.

1jaqa4e,1741909250.0,People only care about me when I almost die,"I’m a 16 year old boy. Two years ago I was in a coma and nearly died it was the first time my whole family were together. I was finally getting noticed by my family. Usually they treat me like the stupid Weird son but they actually cared about me even my sibling who don’t even like me. My younger sister said she loved for the first time since we were kids and my older sibling actually wanted to hang out with me. But it didn’t last for long when I got transferred to the ward I still couldn’t walk. They just left me like nothing and my dad would only see me if he was working in the city that day. For a whole month I was alone in a hospital the only people I had to talk to were other younger kids or nurses

When I finally got back home I had to do a lot of house work while my siblings were just sitting around like I wasn’t still affected by my coma. It was hard to walk I still used a wheel chair and I got tired so easily. The only person I could talk to was my older sister who struggles with depression I hated talking to her because I felt like I was doing more harm than good to her so I stopped and I hide my emotions and put a smile for the next two years

But I’ve started to realise that people only care about me when I go through something traumatic like being kidnapped by your dads ex girlfriend and being in a coma I’ve started to have bad thoughts about doing something too myself so people would care about me. It seems like the only way to get help is to hurt myself I would never do because I don’t want people to think I’m selfish but it’s not fair all of my sibling get attention younger sister is really good at net ball and is smart and wins all theses awards all my older sibling are autistic or have mental health issues or other problems and I’m just sitting alone doing everything for myself.

1jamthr,1741900112.0,Living like this is hell,"Hi! I’m a 16 year old guy living with my parents and my older sister. (20f)
ever since I was a kid there have been constant issues, my sister failed various classes and made up extravagant lies to others to garner attention. There was no childhood trauma for her, she was raised and loved by both of my parents even after my birth. She was given every resource needed to succeed and accommodate her no matter what new diagnosis or medication she had. 
When I was 7 she sexually assaulted me with the full intent to do so. That left me extremely scarred and immediately caused me to fear her which lead to resentment. My parents raised me in a very similar manner to my sister and many disorder’s I’ve been diagnosed with are merely hereditary or caused from the damage my sister has caused. My parents did everything from testing to therapy to medical treatments and medication, but they will not put her in a ward or home. She is willingly unhygienic and lazy, she has destroyed the upstairs in which she lives by her bodily fluids. I haven’t been up there in some times due to how awful the smell is but it’s a mix of anything you could probably get out of your body. She will destroy things and blow money for no reason and acts purely on impulse. She has little to no teeth as she ripped them out starting around my age. She gained fifty pounds within the past year due to her no longer having a job she quit and doing nothing with her life. She sleeps with a countless amount of men and does this all out of her own free will. She is a toddler in a sense, if she doesn’t get her way she will scream and cry and throw a literal tantrum in the sense that a young child would. She’ll be petty and mock and make fun of others as an elementary bully does. Some days she will act completely innocent, like she’s never done a thing wrong in her life and she’s completely helpless. Other days she’s extremely “ghetto” in a sense, acting like she’s someone in the streets of a run down town and talking back with slurs and words she can’t even say. She’s run away various times, and now that she’s an adult my parents can’t do anything about it. Almost every test has been positive but I’ve always been so certain none of them are correct. Medication won’t work and she merely lies in therapy the entire time, my parents have given up years ago after she made it very clear she won’t put in any effort to better her life despite having the resources and support to do so.

This has lead to my own troubles of emotional regulation to where I take matters into my own hands and resort to violence to defend myself of her, and I’ve grown to become a short tempered person who has urges to physically put people in their place. I cannot handle certain sounds as they bring me back to certain times where something horrible went wrong, and I’ll end up a mess on the floor. I hate going home, knowing she’ll be there.

I genuinely cannot live like this anymore, it’s been 16 years of torture and college seems like the only way out for me but I don’t want my parents to suffer. Please, if there’s any suspicion or hint on what’s wrong with her or what can be done please tell me. She cannot be treated lightly as you will be manipulated and harmed further. I can’t live like this, this isn’t how a family should live and it’s torn us all apart.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1jamthr/living_like_this_is_hell/,hi im year old guy living parents older sister f ever since kid constant issues sister failed various classes made extravagant lies others garner attention childhood trauma raised loved parents even birth given every resource needed succeed accommodate matter new diagnosis medication sexually assaulted full intent left extremely scarred immediately caused fear lead resentment parents raised similar manner sister many disorders ive diagnosed merely hereditary caused damage sister caused parents everything testing therapy medical treatments medication put ward home willingly unhygienic lazy destroyed upstairs lives bodily fluids havent times due awful smell mix anything could probably get body destroy things blow money reason acts purely impulse little teeth ripped starting around age gained fifty pounds within past year due longer job quit nothing life sleeps countless amount men free toddler sense doesnt get way scream cry throw literal tantrum sense young child would shell petty mock make fun others elementary bully days act completely innocent like shes never done thing wrong life shes completely helpless days shes extremely ghetto sense acting like shes someone streets run town talking back slurs words cant even say shes run away various times shes adult parents cant anything almost every test positive ive always certain none correct medication wont work merely lies therapy entire time parents given years ago made clear wont put effort better life despite resources support lead troubles emotional regulation take matters hands resort violence defend ive grown become short tempered person urges physically put people place handle certain sounds bring back certain times something horrible went wrong ill end mess floor hate going home knowing shell genuinely live like anymore years torture college seems like way dont want parents suffer please theres suspicion hint whats wrong done please tell treated lightly manipulated harmed cant live like isnt family live torn us apart

1jaj0n1,1741890550.0,I've become delusionally depressed and I can't afford to be,"There's a sort of ""stage"" of clynical depression where the affected person engages in reality denial, or can't seem to make sense of even obvious solutions, in a way that feeds or enables the depression.

An example is a patient has intensive surgery that has them glued to a hospital bed for months. During physical therapy they're improving their mobility, as indicated by a progressive increase in laps around the hospital, but the patient chocks it up to the hospital doing renovation work that shortens the hallways.

Every direction feels like a dead end that only serves to continue for the sake of it. Like going on only serves to feed the thing killing the host. I know on paper there is a way out of this, just not for me. There's a sense of having fallen too far that makes every effort seem insulting or futile.

The thing I feel shame for is that I knew this was a dangerous place to get to for a long time. I told myself it would never happen to me. Between 2 years of not drinking, my grandfather coming down with dementia, an urgent move, evenrs in my country, and a constant influx of relatives that rips open some deep wounds, a once defiant insistence on continuing has halted into this whimpering urge to curl up and be left alone. 

I used to have a lot to want to live for. I still technically do. I just feel like my inner and outer world disappeared all at once and I don't know who I am anymore.

I don't medicate except for Marijuana, and I don't have insurance.

1jai557,1741888391.0,I’m a recent grad/aspiring federal employee in Washington DC and I feel completely helpless.,"For all of my time in college all I dreamed of was federal employment, becoming a federal agent specifically. I graduated high school with a 1.99 GPA and was segregated to special education classes due to being diagnosed with high functioning autism and ADHD, so I already started college at a disadvantage. Despite my challenges, I managed to graduate with honors with a degree in political science , being in 2 executive level leadership roles in student community service organizations, and interned at one of the largest police departments in the US. I even got automatically accepted into my college’s law school on account of my grades. I eventually managed to land a job as a campus police officer in Washington DC and I was thrilled to be in the perfect position for a foot in the door.

For a few months I was starting to get referred for several federal jobs and it looked like I was about to achieve my dream.  Then all the sudden DOGE came along and almost all federal jobs I got referred for were cancelled. Then I ended up being let go from my job during my probationary period despite being a good officer who passed FTO with glowing evaluations. I strongly believe it had to do with my disability status (I have more on that in my post history). I quickly ended up with another local police job but it only pays $47,000 which is literally poverty wages in DC.

I feel completely trapped and helpless, seeing these mass federal layoffs and mass federal hiring freezes feels like watching all of my dreams burn right in front of me. Pretty much anything I’m qualified for that pays decent revolves around the government in some way and the career field I studied to go into is probably in one of the worst localized recessions in US history. Being a member of the LGBTQ community, I’m also really nervous about my rights. Now all I see is constant talk about how I’m a “DEI hire” and don’t even deserve job I have currently. I feel absolutely despised and viewed like a parasite. I don’t know anyone in this city I can lean on for support, I’m broke, and it feels like all of my achievements and the impossible odds I overcame don’t even matter.

1jaev0u,1741880314.0,Going through a difficult time,"Trigger warnings: self harm/addiction 


I (25F) have struggled with mental health issues from the age of 10, grew up in a household with a BPD/traumatized mother that relied on me a lot for emotional support but also could never provide me support. When my mental health took a real nose dive during college I started smoking mj and drinking to cope. I got into a relationship with someone with narcissistic traits and was on and off in that relationship, it caused me a lot of pain and trauma. He was abusive in all ways. I was isolating myself and SH. After college I lived at home for a year which was kind of a nightmare. Then I moved to another state for a job and still struggled to manage there, I was well liked and did good work but was lonely and still abusing mj and alcohol. I ended up developing an addiction to shoplifting and eventually got caught and had to go to court. 

Luckily this was my first ever brush with the law and got the lightest sentence. Flash forward a year and I got a dream job at a residential psychiatric facility for teens struggling with BPD. I felt this was a great fit because I have experience with mental health struggles and DBT which is the type of therapy they do at the facility. For some reason the background check did not catch my shoplifting charge the first time around so I was fine but 6 months into my job I get a call from HR telling me I can’t come into work. I end up having to submit all this information about the charge, court documents, two letters of recommendation attesting that this won’t interfere with my work with minors, and a personal statement. The bureaucratic nature of this has left me unable to go to work for about 3 months. I am still awaiting their descison on whether or not I can return and pass the background check. The state board cannot give me any type of timeline. At first I started smoking every day and then realized I needed to stop. I started going to marijuana anonymous meetings, was regularly taking my antidepressants, exercising every day, meditating, journaling, reading, doing hobbies. I have 32 days of sobriety from weed under my belt. I have a somewhat new boyfriend that has been incredibly supportive throughout this I am so grateful. Despite these healthy changes I got drunk a couple of times and felt horrible about it and the last time led to a self harm relapse. My boyfriend came over to support me and I felt awful. Ever since I stopped smoking my ptsd symptoms due to my childhood and past DV/SA have been coming back. I feel like I’m too “messed up” for my job or to become a therapist or that I’m only doing it because it’s what I was basically trained to do from an early age in my family. I know it isn’t so black and white and my experiences make me good at what I do but this is easily the most stressful time of my life and I’m struggling to find self love. If anyone can offer words of support I’d appreciate that a lot.

1jad56s,1741875837.0,Concerns about new medication (Mood stabilizers for deep depression),"Not sure if this is the right place, but I just wanted to hear about other people opinion and experiences. 

I (30F) have been diagnosed with deep depression (drug-resistant) for years now. Have tried a couple different antidepressants with little to no improvement. Currently I only take vyvanse as it is the only thing which makes me a functioning human being, and rivotril when needed.

A quick overview of my mental health (without vyvanse) would be that Im mostly always depressed/very low energy, with eventual changes where I get more ""awaken"", motivated, have ideas, do things, so and so. I would not describe this as ""mania"" because my energy level is still so low compared with a normal person, but I feel better during in these phases, as I am desperate to have energy and do things. But they are also short lived and very sparse.  I may also have autism, but I haven't seek a diagnostic. 

My doctor recently prescribed me mood stabilizers, starting today. It seems that there are evidences that it can be helpful for my type of depression, but I am concerned it will ""flatten"" my higher-energy peaks and make me stay in the middle of the way between barely function and functional depressed person. 

What I hope is that it will help me feel more like when I am in the good phases.

Maybe this is just overthinking because its what I do. And when this happens I like to read about other peoples experiences, so it would be nice if anyone else with a similar place could tell me a little about their experience.

I always fail to meet most goals that I set, no matter how simple. I make elaborate plans to improve **but always end up sabotaging myself**. I have ambitions and long term goals but my actions are the exact opposite. 

One example: I had an end term exam where I was sure to fail if I did not study. I told myself that I will finish studying 3 days before.( actually very ez). That became 1 day. Then the very morning. Even in the morning I did not study properly (wasted time on reddit.) **Then I gave up. I FAILED.** The same has happened so many times, you would not believe it. 

FYI: My mode of procrastination is mindless internet surfing. I don't do it on my smartphone (everything blocked). I do it on my laptop instead. No matter what I try, I cannot live without mindless scrolling. I want it to feel normal.  Also, I have a p\*rn addiction which I can't quit no matter what.

1ja8dm2,1741859676.0,I feel so hopeless (relapse),"Hello, I’m not usually one to post but I need to get this off my chest somehow...

It’s been really hard, I can’t tell anyone irl so why not the internet?

Recently, ever since exams have started, I’ve been looking at myself so lowly. I feel so stupid and like I’m brainless or something. My self esteem has been so low to the point where I don’t see myself as a valuable person anymore or even AS a person at all, I feel like I shouldn’t have been birthed at all and that I’m just a burden to everyone I love and trust and that I shouldn’t have existed. I have a long history with self- harm, I’m disappointed with myself because I recently relapsed. No one knows I did because if I told anyone, I’m 100% sure they’d yell at me instead of listening to what my thoughts have been..

Ive been isolating myself from my friends and even from my family- I feel like I don’t deserve them, like It’s better if I wasn’t here to be such a burden to them. All my friends are smart, pretty, witty, funny, talented, and popular.. I love them so much but they have other friends who are as smart as them, as pretty as them, as popular as them, as talented as them.. I’m just me, a brainless person who’s mediocre compared to them, a person only there to make them laugh and to entertain them because that’s the only thing I’m good at. We’re usually a group of four but I feel like recently they’ve been replacing me…(maybe I’m overthinking it actually lol) I doubt that I’m any use for them at this point. My family, they could have more opportunities if I weren’t here to drag them down, if I wasn’t so mentally ill and utterly stupid, they’d have someone to be proud of. It’s come to the point where I don’t think I’m worth anything anymore… Intrusive thoughts of running away, cutting everyone off, and “selling my body because my body’s the only thing that has worth” or simply just ending my life have been plaguing me and driving me insane. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

Thank you for reading this stupid vent, I hope I don’t sound like some emo brat who wants attention…lol. Also sorry for any punctuation mistakes… English isn’t my first language, sorry in advance.

Help notflications

Hey. I went to sleep in 11:30 PM (23:30) and put my phone on airplane mode. Didn’t pick it up or touch it until 7:22 AM this morning. I swiped the screen and saw I have a gmail notflication under “notflication centre” in 3:25 AM (from aliexpress). I then entered the gmail app and saw I also got an email in 2:26 AM but I had no notflication about this one whatsoever (from steam). Why? I only turned off airplane mode in 7:22 AM when Iwoke up, so why when I scrolled my screen the Ali express notification was under “notflication centre” words instead of just appearing there (if you know what I mean.) and why didn’t I get the steam notflication one?

1ja41qj,1741840312.0,Useless,"I feel. Useless. I have a boyfriend, and I love him. But I question if I hate him. Or love him at all. I dont care for anyone else, but it. It hurts when he deserves so much love and I have thoughts thst stray away from me loving him. I dont have a clue what to do. I have suicidal thoughts and they're a bit more apparent as of recent. Because it seems he's always pissed at me some times but he says he isn't. I'm a male too, and we aren't in a toxic relationship at all, I've had one before and it wasn't fun. But.

It feels every decision I make in my life. I only fuck up. I'll accidently ignore him, and he'll ignore me back but worse bc he has BPD, and I'll feel like he hates me or my abandonment issues come up bc of him. Or we won't talk to me about his mental health. Or change tendencies. Etc etc. I'm at a point of having a big argument and asking. What I did. Because it feels unfair. But I know he doesn't mean it. But at times. I feel so uncared and just put to the side. From the one person who gives a shit about me. Then I feel alone like before we were together. I just.

I need help. Please don't assume I'm in a toxic relationship, he's helped with so much and I know it'd a healthy one, it's just. I cannot explain and show the good parts of it right now. So without the good, ofc this seems like a ""leave him, or you'll die"" but it feels like he's the only reason im here.

Please I need someone to talk to. Just to vent in dms or something. Bc life is getting too much.

Over the past year, I feel like my anxiety has only grown. I feel like I try to do what seems right at the time but later feels like the wrong thing. I feel like a weirdo sometimes at work because I overthink what i’m going to say to the point I stutter. I have experienced a lot of trauma since 2020 and it feels like my life did a complete 180. I look back and feel like I was so much more happier and confident in myself and somehow along the lines I lost all of it. Sometimes I have complete meltdowns and it seems like my emotions are always on extremes. I feel like a total asshole and jerk and I really want to be better and do better. My fear of being a bad person has become a total obsession and I feel like it consumes me. My anxiety is so overwhelming and I constantly freak out about it. 

My partner recently switched to night shift and I work mornings so we don’t see each other until late at night briefly and the weekends. The first month I had complete breakdowns because I was so worried someone would break in. I couldn’t take a shower without constantly checking the house. I still can’t sleep in the bedroom until he comes home! Now that the anxiety of a break in has gone away, i’m always sitting my thoughts and overthinking my life and what it means to be a good person.

So I tend to do what I think is disassociating, I'm not 100% sure. But when I'm having depression or anxiety, I will go just in my head and stay there. Sometimes I just think, sometimes I just day dream, sometimes I just imagine myself in situations that I would enjoy being in. Or like imagining myself living my dream life. It's like I'm making a movie in my head and watching it. 

I do this so often that sometimes I forget parts of my day, since I'm just going through my motions and not really there. Ive had  people many people say this is bipolar.

1j9tzwc,1741811264.0,"Help please, I can't eat.","TW‼️ (potential ED, abuse, SH, addiction, alcoholism) PLEASE DO NOT READ IF TRIGGERED BY THESE TOPICS‼️

Let me clarify by saying that I’m not sure if this is my mental or physical health.  I don't know what to do anymore. I have been dealing with this problem for maybe 2-3 years now, but it’s consistently getting worse by the day. I've brought it up to multiple different primary care doctors in the past and was always brushed off and given a referral to a psychiatrist. (maybe due to my age, I’m 19, a lot of people think I am overreacting or being a “drama queen.”) 

Here is my story: 

My parents were in a very bad abusive relationship. My father was an alcoholic/addict, very neglectful, and very mentally abusive to us, and physically to my mother. My mom worked nights and slept all day 6-7 days/week. By the time I was 6 or 7, I was very smart and became an honor student in school. This translated to my parents as, “Oh so you can teach your sister.” So, now, I’m not only raising my little sister, but myself. My parents divorced when I was 10 years old, and quickly after the separation, my dad became physically abusive to me, and my mom lost her job and resorted to drugs. I began working for a family friend at 11 years old and was helping pay my mother's mortgage. Eventually, she lost the house to foreclosure. I was hospitalized multiple times, twice at 13, once at 14, and once at 15 for s*icide attempts and SH. I got another job legally at 14, and at 15, I basically hired a lawyer and ran away with my sister. We moved in with my grandmother across the country, and when I got there, I was a junior in high school with 8 credits and a 0.8 GPA. I had given up around 7th grade, and I worked my ASS OFF, and graduated with my full credit diploma, on time. I went to beauty school, I enrolled in college, and now I’m struggling with this. I seemed to be doing good, so I’m confused. 

Okay, so that's what I went through. Here is what I’m struggling with: 
My husband (yes I’m married, I know I’m young, I don’t wanna hear it please, we get judged enough.) is currently in basic training for the Army. I will admit that I am severely emotionally attached to him, I am very anxious and this is not a great thing for this situation. He left on February 4th, and since he left, my ability to eat has decreased. I am 5’2 and I weigh 120 LBS, however, this doesn't concern me. What concerns me is the fact that I weighed 132 when he left. I literally cannot physically force myself to eat. I’m so hungry but I sit down to eat and I take a bite and my immediate reaction is to throw up. I don’t know what to do :( I cry almost every day. AND PLEASE NOTE, I WANT TO EAT! I just want to enjoy food again. When this problem started, I had comfort foods that I could stomach, like chicken noodle soup, chicken pot pie, and chili. Now I can't even stomach 3 bites. 

my goal in posting this is hopefully to receive some insight into what this could possibly be or mean for me, and any guidance in the right direction to heal. Sorry for the essay, thank you!

Social anxiety, performance anxiety (im a musician) ect..
I also struggle with depression, i dont know what kind, but i think about suicide, like alot. Mostly jokingly lately, for example. 
""Oh i dont have to go do that thing if i kill myself lol"" idk, everything is very..... dull? When im low, colours are less bright, music doesnt hit the same, you know? 
Anyways 
Im with a new therapist so, yeah. But i dont see them again for another two weeks.
And everytime i try to think of someone to talk to i realize how alone i am, all my friends arent aware of my shit, my best friend is aware, but i feel like if i tell them ill exhaust them.
I dont want to hurt people and i feel their deep sadness, regret...
Just the raw horror whenever i talk about something like this even a little bit.
I dont want to be a burden. I dont want to exhaust the people i love.
Anyway, 

The point I came here to make, aka what tf the title is talking about
I havent been able to cry for...... a while? Im not sure how long, something similar happened a couple of years ago, but not like this, that was...... numb?
I feel this
It hurts so much.
Not like a physical pain, something sharp and demanding. Ive experienced that, ive had my palm ripped open! I know pain
Pain can be.... satisfying in a way. Your body telling you where the problem is, you resolve it and the pain goes away. Easy, simple. 
Its concise 
But this is...... worse
Its like this dull pain, and you cant find a place to pin it to so your brain just sits there in a corner, silent tears running down its face saying 
""........it hurts""
And i feel it
I feel it  _so much_ 
And i want to cry, and i start.
My eyes tear up, my lip quivers, the whole 9 yards
Then i smile
Involuntarily 
This horrible, massive grimace of a smile, all my teeth showing, mouth open
And i laugh, a small breathy chuckle. The kind you let out in relief but much less satisfying.
And i cant stop. I cant stop smiling without stopping the crying
And i do.
I push it down, the tears and the horrifying smile go away. But the pain doesn't 
Tears are how our bodies get rid of excess emotion and i cant FUCKING DO IT RIGHT
i have had a debilitating almost migraine like tension headache all day because of a deadline.
And i cannot cry
I am in an unbelievable amount of physical and mental pain and i can do nothing about it

Whats wrong with me? WHY AM I LIKE THIS!?
Im like the fucking joker lmao! wtf?!
I dont want to be like this. I just want to be fucking NORMAL
I WANT TO FEEL NORMAL
i want to hold a damn conversation without being anxious
Make a joke that isnt fucking depressing
I want to MOTHERFUCKING CRY
BUT I CANT
BECAUSE MY DUMBASS BRAIN IS BROKEN!!!!!

I want to fucking scream. But when you scream people ask what's wrong, and i know that they dont want to know. They want an awnser like i ""stepped in glass""
Not that i fantasize about walking into the ocean and not walking back out
Not that
Never that
No one wants to hear that.
What could they even do? Look at me differently? With sadness and pity? Maybe they could send me self help shit everyday that dont help, maybe they could hug me and cry because thats a fucking normal response, and make me feel awkward as shit.
Maybe they could treat me like a glass landmine.
Something that could explode with a misplaced breath.
Maybe they could stop talking to me. Because who needs a fucking burden in their lives? A liability? 
Not them.
So....

1j9nb8s,1741795018.0,I feel as if I’m being punished by my own body for trying to help myself.,"I’ve dealt with mental health issues since middle school — I am now a college junior. I tried to take antidepressants during COVID but they were not effective and I quit them.

Since then I have gotten so much worse. I decided 3 weeks ago to contact a psychiatrist and start taking medication again. Rather than a depressive disorder, they concluded I have a mood disorder. I started a mood stabilizer… woke up the next morning after my first dose ill with flu-like symptoms. I assumed I got it from my professor. Once I was semi-better, I suddenly got rashy and it was found that I was having an allergic reaction to it. Somewhat discouraging, but I quit. Then the steroids I took made me hyper, in pain, and with an absurdly high heart rate. I had a nightmare and dealt with uncontrollable tremors that calmed down after an hour. I lost my marbles in the middle of a college lecture. But my mental health was beginning to decline again and I couldn’t stand it. I followed up with a different psychiatrist (the first was on vacation). We started an antipsychotic that was initially mentioned with the first psychiatrist. At 3 in the morning I awoke suddenly to, once again, a severely high heart rate, shaking, dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, and worsened anxiety. I was trying to be more optimistic despite my symptoms but now they’ve persisted and I’m going to get an EKG done to determine just what is going on.

I feel like I’m being punished for trying to take initiative for my mental health. I don’t know why. It’s been a burst of specific pain, then a suddenly elevated heart rate, then some suicidal ideation, then a headache, and so on… I’ve suffered for so long mentally, and now I must suffer physically just for wanting help? Why is this happening to me? When did I become so sensitive to medication? I just don’t understand. I want it to stop. I want to be healthy again.

EDIT/UPDATE (3/13): I’ve gotten an answer. It’s nasty sinus tachycardia from my steroids that was slightly exacerbated by my antipsychotic. So I’m on track to slowly get better with plenty of rest (when possible), hydration, and some needed lifestyle changes (also when possible). I’ve since this post felt somewhat better physically and mentally. It’s still somewhat disturbing how my body was being the way that it was.

1j9r79j,1741804495.0,idk when to just give up on therapy,"for context, i'm 24 and dealing with eating disorder(s) since 2017

i've been seeing various counselors, therapists, doctors, dieticians, etc since 2020. I've been seeing my current therapist for almost a year now.  She diagnosed me with binge eating disorder and depression, which I agree with

After several months she pushed me to try medication--I was hesitant because I was afraid that it would just make me less sad > less motivated to get better > increase my binge eating. Despite that, I agreed and have been on meds for over a month now. Guess what happened? Yeah

So after years of different approaches, counseling, self-help, CBT/DBT/etc, therapy, and now medication, i have made negative progress. I wish i could go back a few years to when i was still mentally ill but not as bad. All these years, and  I still have no idea what my triggers/causes are, it seems like everything and nothing will set me off. I've told all this to my therapists, doctors, etc but don't really get a concrete response

I have a full-time job and rent my own apartment, I don't have the money or time to go to some inpatient facility (i am very leery of eating disorder inpatient places anyway). I'm trying to join support groups but there's nothing in-person in my area and i struggle with stupid zoom calls with people that i cant relate much to

i'm so close to just giving up and letting the worst in me take over. I don't know where else to find strength. (I am religious so please don't tell me to turn to God, I am don't worry) I know change has to come from inside myself but it feels like the parasite in me is bigger than I am and I've already lost. I don't know what else to do

1j9r1t0,1741804114.0,Crushes and dating are painful and absolutely impossible with my terrible mental health,"
I am a mentally ill 28M who is neurodivergent (ADHD), severe anxiety/ocd, and I suspect CPTSD as well. When I get crushes, a trigger flips in my head and all in this internal chaos comes out.

I get super overwhelmed and anxious, mood swings, crying spells, can barely interact with said person and things eventually become weird. I all of a sudden become very attached and clingy, and I start overthinking everything. I lose my mind by wondering whether the signs or real or if I am just crazy. 

I have never been able to make moves on girls, and many of them seem to take it personally and resent me for it. They cold or become passive aggressive. 

This has been going on for more than a decade, and I just don’t know how to deal with this anymore. Other guys who were terrible with girls have figured it out, and I just keep going downhill.

The only times I have been able to make it work is when I was prescribed on heavy cocktail of meds and even then I had to ask her out over text because I couldn’t handle it.   

I don’t know what to do anymore. I am done therapy, and it hasn’t done anything for me. 

TLDR can’t figure out my dating life. I go bat shit crazy and lose my mind. I think might die alone.

1j9naux,1741794993.0,Moving out/comfort zone struggle due to mental health,"Hello everyone, I need your help/advice. Sorry if it is long/confusing but English isn’t my native language.

So I (28F) live in a small town in a country in Europe. I grew up here, I always lived here. I never liked it, not the landscape, nor really the work/life balance etc. I have been thinking about moving for a while now, but for several (mostly economic reasons) I am still stuck here.
Now I am kinda at the point where either I move now or I make it work here, although I know that I don’t enjoy it. 

Here, I live in my small apartment at home, in the same building as my family but separate from them. Its nice, although not a place I see myself live in for more than some more years. I have a job offert here that might be interesting, but just compared to other jobs here, so not really something too exciting, just better than most alternatives. I have very few friends, not really any reasons to stay here other than comfort zone (although uncomfortable). I don’t enjoy my life, I just make it through the day. 

Now I kinda have an opportunity to move in a different country, where a good friend of mine lives. She offered me a job, although not a lot of hours/nor good pay. 
Thing is, its really hard to find an apartment in the area where she lives, and those that are available are very expensive. I don’t speak the language (yet) so thats also an issue, although most people speak English as a second language.

My problem is that my mental health isnt good at all, I keep thinking that I want to move, and when I start looking I get discouraged immediately, because of the difficulty in finding a place/moving, and most of all, because I don’t know if I would even like it there! I have been there twice on holiday and I really liked it, but if course thats different than moving there.
I know that probably its just laziness/fear of getting out of the comfort zone, but I dont find the energy to do so, because I know that I will have to settle for what I find in terms of job/apartment in the beginning. I would have to move with my 2 pets, which is also a big problem in terms of costs/logistics/finding a place, as well as losing my current apartment to my younger brother.

I think that my main issue is getting out into the comfort zone into the unknown scares me out more than it excites me! Anyone has been through something similar/has any tips on how to get out of the comfort zone?
Sorry for the rant, and if you made it here, thank you, any advice is highly appreciated!

1j9kvuc,1741788409.0,So tired of being let down in trying to date,"it’s ripping my soul out little by little to build up a relationship with someone I grow to care a lot about, just to have it at longest last a year before I’m back to where I started. After the most recent one I just don’t have the energy to try to build something genuine with someone new, AGAIN. So I’m done trying. Fuck everybody.
I’m done with dating. I have the unlucky circumstance of being gay. So the dating pool is already small. And also finding someone who cares about building a future and a relationship with someone (a committed monogamous relationship) doesn’t seem like it exists in this community. I get called “old fashioned” for not wanting to be in an open relationship and subjecting myself to hook up culture. I’m done because no one wants what I want. Been out of the closet and dating for about 6 years. Most people just wanna fuck, the rest act like they want a relationship until they’re just bored of it and call it quits.
 Everyone just lets me down. And it makes me really sad. I have had 4 relationships in the past few years where I grew to deeply care about people just to never see them again at some point. And it makes me suicidal. 
I’m disowned by my Christian conservative family for being gay. I know and realize I tend to place an over reliance on partners to fill that void I have. But i think it’s time I figure out how to just do that for myself.

1j9hli8,1741777805.0,Who is in the right?,"I am just so confused and exhausted. I am a 14 year old girl and i am just so tired of everything. I have always had problems and arguments with my mum but now im just done. Let me explain everything from recently.

I am struggling with talking, like at all sometimes, as i seem to just not being able to speak or verbalise words when spoken or questioned about anything. It doesn't happen all the time but happens a lot. When i am forced to speak i just feel like i want to break down and cry, self harm as i have done many times before because of this and just get more and more non verbal. I don't know why i do think but i just feel too tired to speak or socialise at all.  I have sensory issues which prevent me from hugging or showing any physical touch or contact, for example the type or feel of shirt someone wears, how their hair feels and even how someone smells. Eye contact its also very hard for me sometimes and also stimming certain words that linger in my mind or what someone says. I also struggle to make friends and i dont really understand others and their emotions or feelings.

Now on to why i'm exhausted and just done.  My mum and i have never been on great terms due to her lack of understanding and not even trying to understand the way i act and why. A couple weeks ago her and i started to have a semi argument about all the stuff i do and why. I have tried countless time trying to explain to her why i do all these thing but honestly its like trying to talk to a brick wall as all she does is get mad. The semi argument ended with her telling me i must have a mental block of somesort and need to see the school guidance counsellor. The next day i did go to the guidance counsellor and had a deep chat with her. After the talk she had stared to explain how everything i have been saying is not something she knows much about but does suspect of Autism and suggests i talk to my family doctor about it. She also said that it would be wise if i talk to my mum about it but i asked if she could call my mum instead. The guidance cousellor and my mum have a long talk and everything is fine. After school my mum was all chappy and happy with what she had heard on the phone has she said it gave her more insight and understanding of everything. I thought that would be the end of it but no. After a week or so she went straight back to normal and had arguments and started saying that i probably don/t even have autism and just stuff like that. So like what is even the reason for anything anymore? So hopefully next monday i get answer so whatever i have gets through my mums thick skull because i feel like if i actually get diagnosed with it then hopefully she would actually try understand and get a grip.

1j99j31,1741748725.0,I need help. What is wrong with me??,"I haven't posted on Reddit before and I don't really know where to start with this or what to include. I know I should be seeking support from a therapist but I can't access one at the moment. but I'll start with the issue that has lead me to be make this post... 

I am 21 Female. living at home with my parents and younger brother. For a long time now I have struggled getting out of bed in the morning and leaving my room when I can hear people in the house. It gives me severe anxiety and as soon as I emerge my room I instantly try not to make eye contact, get agitated waiting for them to speak to me and then become deeply frustrated when they do. It's to the point where I don't get out of bed until the afternoon when I realise I am never going to get a chance to get out of bed with no one home and the whole day is nearly gone or I have to get up for work or I'll be late. So every day I walk past as quickly as possible, give a quick hi with my head down if they talk to me and speed walk into the bathroom where I sit in the bottom of the  shower for an hour trying to pull myself together and also try to figure out why I am like this.

 Some mornings I can't push past it especically when I'm forced to talk more than my usual ""hi"". I try to get ready as quickly as possible and strategicly as possible to not have to make eye contact or speak with anyone but this is quite a hard task as my house only has 5 rooms and my dad is often sitting in the  room located right outside my bedroom door so by the time I leave the house I'm an anxious mess. I don't know why I feel this way. I haven't always been like this. There are alot of ideas I've come up with that could be contributing factors but none that feel like enough of a reason to behave like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I don't want to treat my parents this way. Especially my dad who is kind to me and is only trying to say good morning. 

A one theory I have is it that I am becoming non verbal in the morning which is a common trait of autism (which I am not diagnosed with but am sure I have// my brother was diagnosed severely autistic as a child and is partially non verbal. He is 20 years old now and has learnt to say a few sentences that make sense mixed with alot of gibberish phrases.) 

Second theory is it may have developed over the past few years... Before my dog Lilly, a  16year old english Staffordshire passed away in January she was old and suffering from cancer. Her whole life my brother had pestered her by sitting on her, pulling her ears and tail, pinching her but she was the sweetest thing and never fought back. I tried to defend her as much as possible, especially as she got older and developed a cancerous lesion on her tail which my brother wouldn't stop touching with dirty hands and making it  infected. He also often has tantrums and would run into my room  while me and Lilly were asleep in bed and try to pinch her or hurt her in some way so I learnt to constantly listen to everything as I sleep and spring up to defend lilly instantly whenever I heard footsteps near my room or hear my door open. I wonder if the habit of this contributes to why I lay there anxiously listening but it would only explain fear of my brother. 

My mother has meltdowns herself occasionally but never tries to hurt me not did she try to hurt Lilly when she was alive. She lives in a van now and comes and goes when she likes but when I was a child and she lived in the house with us she would wake up every day and start yelling, throwing things around and slamming doors usually because there was mess she didn't like (toys on the floor, dishes not done, laundry) so alot of my childhood was spent walking in egg shells. My mum was an alcoholic and spent all of her time either at the pub, throwing up in the bathroom or yelling at us for the house not being the way she wanted. 

My dad is an amazing man. He did everything for me and my brother growing up and still continues to now. He cares for my brother full time and would do anything for me but I still feel this resentment towards him and I don't understand why. In the morning he is the person I avoid the most (possibly because he is the hardest to avoid?)and I don't understand why. Maybe it's because of his judgmental nature. Often criticizing people who aren't as mentally strong as him and need drugs and alcohol to cope, calling them selfish (I personally use weed to cope with all I've been through in life. I experienced some quite traumatic event in my early teens. I was groomed by a 21 year old crackhead who I ended up living with for a year at age 13 who abused me in countless ways) 
My dad also palms me off when I try to tell him I think I'm autistic or have other mental health issues which makes it really hard to connect with him emotionally. 

As much as I feel I have answered my own question here I still don't feel satisfied with my answers. I feel like I'm just whinging. Why do I feel these emotions. I know my life isn't that bad and my dad is such as amazing man. He's done so much for me and I can tell he's worried about me since I've been so closed off and often breaking down into tears as I'm leaving home. I don't understand why I struggle to talk to him lately. Whenever I am home I just have this feeling inside me like I'm going to explode out of my skin.

1j9d2kf,1741759977.0,"Recently Laid Off, Struggling to Keep Things Together","Hello,

I recently experienced an unexpected layoff from my previous job, and I find myself struggling to make ends meet. On top of that, I am responsible for helping my little brother with his studies and supporting my father’s daily health maintenance, which has left me financially strained. I also have mounting debt that I’ve been unable to pay off, as most of my earnings have gone toward supporting my family.

I’ve been doing everything I can to hold it together, but it’s been difficult. I can’t even sleep at night because the stress feels overwhelming, and I’m honestly feeling paralyzed by the situation.

I am running out of funds, and I need to secure a job to survive. I’m willing to take on any work—whether it’s remote work from home or physical jobs. I’m even open to opportunities abroad as long as the employer is willing to support me and sponsor everything. I’m determined to work hard and do whatever it takes to improve my situation.

If anyone knows of any opportunities, I would greatly appreciate your help or guidance.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

1j90ael,1741723783.0,My brother asked me to help him with his wife who is suffering from paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations.,"I posted this 4 days ago but nobody responded so I'm posting it again in the hopes that someone offers some advice.

Brother asked me to help him deal with his psychotic wife

Hello,

There's a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My brother lives with his wife and her 15 year old son. About 2 or 3 months ago she began to experience paranoid delusions with auditory hallucinations. She thought there were cameras watching her in a particular room she spent time in. It began centralized in that single room but eventually branched out to the entire house. 

Over time, she had developed these conspiracy theories that CPS was stalking her and would take her son away. She believes there is a federal case against her. She has called the police, the FBI, and lawyers. The police gave my brother information on government mental health programs but she refuses to go because she believes they're out to get her. She will say that she's willing to get a psych evaluation but always has an excuse not to go when he brings it up. 

This weekend the situation has become more serious. My brother drove her to another city so she could take care of her father, who was recently diagnosed with late stage cancer. He found her climbing into the attic with his samurai sword trying to find some device she believed was monitoring her. He tried to take it from her and things got violent. The cops were called and her poor father was arrested. My brother picked her up and took her back home. 

She's now there being a total wreck. She won't do anything to help herself. She won't contribute. He has to do everything by himself and he's becoming far too strained. He's asked for me help in dealing with her. 

You should know that we all suspect her of abusing drugs. She has a history of drug abuse and does not have very much self control. The drugs I know she used in the past include meth and air dusters. Whippets. THC. I don't know about any others. Meth would certainly explain these symptoms. But my brother has seen no evidence. No smells. She may be eating the meth. But he doesn't know how she could be getting it. At this point it might be possible the extended drug abuse has caused permanent psychosis. I've seen that in other people. But I'm not a mental health professional. I'm a former addict and alcoholic. So I know quite a bit about drug abuse. And I've been around a lot of people with various afflictions. 

What advice can I relay to my brother in how to deal with her? How can he convince her to get a psych evaluation? He doesn't want to kick her out. 

TL;DR: My brother's wife has psychosis, paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, conspiracy theories, and is a danger to herself, her son, and my brother. What can I do to help them? What advice can I relay to him? 

Thank you.

1j8y2fv,1741718358.0,I dont know if i need proffesional help or not,"I know theres something wrong with me, but i dont really have a reason to. Its not like theres a specific traumatic event that triggered this, and my life is pretty good overall. I dont even really know whats wrong, thats why im so frustrated. I mean, I got bullied at school a few years ago, (currently 15 y/o) but thats over now, so idk why i would still be bothered by it. I still worry about what everyone thinks about me, even tho i get enough support from people around me. I struggle with sh, have for a while, and ive had suicidal thoughts. That should be serious enough to get help right? But still it doesnt feel like it, because it doesnt affect my life in general. Sure i feel like shit, but i still get good grades, get out of bed, and do normal things. Its more just a weird mindset that im stuck in. But because im only like struggling inside my mind, it never feels serious enough to get help. I would love to finally be able to talk to someone about all this, but i have no idea how to even approach my parents (or anyone) about this. Because to everyone else, im doing fine. Like i said, good grades, good friends, no outside issues, and i can function in life just fine. And i remember last year my mentor at school emailed my mom about potentially getting me a therapist or something so i could stop stressing about P.E., but my mom thought like ""i mean, its not like you like that subject, so its not neccesairy, right?"" And i just went along with it because i didnt want to tell her i was actually strugglint with way more in my head. Body image, dysphoria, sh, and whatever else. I just have all these problems in my head and all these bad thoughts, but nothing ever happens so it seems all fine. And in a way it is, just not to me, yk? Another example is how almost every time i eat, i think about being scared to gain weight, about how im scared how ill look, about how unhealthy it is, how i shouldnt eat so much, etc. But i never actually stop eating, so it seems all fine.

1j8vvgw,1741712996.0,Why can’t I feel anything?,"I am not looking for a diagnosis from reddit, all I am looking for is some answers, maybe something that my feelings all link to so I can hopefully understand how to properly diagnosed in the future if need be.

I’m a 16 year old girl and I can’t make connections with people, I am popular, I have lots of friends, I have people who consider me a best friend, and yet I feel emotionally connected to none of them.

I can make friends easily I have no issue with that, but If they genuinely all passed away I don’t think I would even care. I don’t even feel bad about saying that, It’s just weird since I have people in my life that would die for me, and I’m just so tired of having to fake that level of connection and intimacy.

Same thing with men, I’ve never had a relationship even though i’ve had plenty of chances, i’m always the one to turn them down and reject them or just outright sabotage myself. I don’t know why I don’t feel the need for a relationship, and I don’t even feel a deep need for connection either, I don’t feel a deep need for anything, I genuinely cannot feel anything and I don’t know why.

It genuinely makes me angry when i’m talking to  my friends and they complain about caring way too much about other people, because what? How can you care at all, why can’t I care like you?

There has been no extreme catalyst for these feelings in my life apart from my parents. My mum is slightly narcissistic but I can live with that, I have kept things bottled up for the longest time without knowing, and only now have I began to explore my emotions more clearly, to which I can really thank my friends for, but once again I can’t even feel gratitude which makes me feel weird, I don’t want to have to be fake to people

Life is so boring, without care, I don’t want to be here anymore, I genuinely can’t even say when it all started, I just want answers and ways to fix it quickly, if theres any medication I can take or shit like that, I just want help, but I feel as though I can’t get there without a solid understanding of what is wrong with me, I don’t know anymore

Now for 2 years im struggling with fysical issues. Apparently my stomach gets sick if I have stress. They call it pds/ibs here but idk is its the same as in english. 
Im full of stress all the time. I overwork myself with pleasing others. Because the anxiety to fail someone is bigger then my mental or fysical state. I know very toxic habit. So Im always exhausted bcs of doing so much for others. Cant relax or anything... Its just also I cant see that I did alot. I always feel like a failure or like im lazy bcs of this mental health crap.

So now im kinda forced to relax bcs or else TW ED I can't eat for shi..
Bcs my stomach will literally hurt.

So can you maybe tell me what you do to relax? Whats selfcare for you? What gives you less panic attacks etc etc?

Im also in exposure therapy to become more relaxed when im outside. So there is alot going on atm therapy, seeing doctors for stomach, TW assault ...also 2weeks ago I got assaulted (no sa) on the streets while going to an appointment to the gynecologist. ( life is great damn) im also  on a weightloss journey ( lost +30kgs now).... so yeah pls help a girl out to relax pls..
I really liked reading & watching movies. But lately I can only finish 1 book ans then drop the series ( even if the book is good) , I can't watch movies without trying to scratch my hands and head nervously. (I make wounds) I tried walking or work out, sometimes it helps but bcs of my stomach problems its not so fun to work out when you are sick... I tried drawing and sometimes it does help but when it doesn't turn out like i wanted ...I will be angry at myself...

For a little while now I have had trouble regulating my emotions when talking to my partner. Whenever she is upset or talking with me about her mental health, I find it really difficult not to break down too and it usually ends up with me crying and her having to care for me. When that happens I really can't be there for her properly and that puts pressure on her to reassure me and take care of me, when I just really want to be present and listen to her. I love her so so much and I just get so overwhelmed and worried about her when we have these discussions and i just want her to feel well. Its such a terrifying feeling not be able to help really when she's not feeling well mentally and I just want to solve it for her. I want her to not have to worry about taking care of me when we have these moments. Just wondering if anyone has some advice or tools I can use to greater control my emotions in these instances or has experiences a similar thing, it would be greatly appreciated!

1j8mokg,1741684693.0,My Life Is Out of Control,"I’m not a lazy person, but I find it incredibly hard to push myself to work and do something significant. My entire conscious life, I have been completely dependent on my family, who provided for my education and everything else. I never really had a childhood—no socializing with other kids, no freedom—just endless studying and activities I hated, which drained every part of me.

I was always burdened with extreme responsibility, so I never experienced my teenage years the way I should have. My life felt like an endless hell of suffering, and it seemed like it would never end.

Then, someone came into my life. Someone who had almost nothing but still pulled me out of that hell—at the cost of their own health and personal life. They took me under their wing, helped me in every possible way. But in the end, we both ended up trapped. We had an agreement: in return for all this help, we would work together on a major project.

But I kept resisting. I was so exhausted from working like crazy and being torn between two extremes: staying in the familiar pain or stepping into something new, knowing there would be no turning back. And now, for over a year, we haven’t been actively working on anything. I haven’t brought in a single cent or a single client—though I’ve created incredible designs, marketing materials, and more.

My resistance comes from my fear of independence, my fear of taking responsibility for myself. I have no addictions, except for one—I endlessly eat and waste my energy on meaningless social interactions. No one knows what I’m really going through. I realize that I’m behaving like a parasite, like a child who refuses to grow up. But after years of endless suffering, moving toward success and independence feels unbearably painful.

You get so used to the violence, to the struggle, that the mere idea of another life doesn’t just seem impossible—it feels unbearable.

I don’t know what to do. I have a deadline in two days, and I have nothing to show for it. I feel like I’m making the biggest mistake of my life, and I don’t know how to recover. Please, help me.

I don’t remember when exactly it started, but every time I break down or start to cry, my brain will suddenly hit a subconscious switch and shut off everything I’m feeling. These break downs already are triggered by small things that my head twists into something more hurtful and big and they always happen when I’m alone (I have a hard time expressing more negative emotions in front of people close to me). I’ll just be sitting in my room sobbing to myself in the dark and out of nowhere that switch will flip and everything just stops. It’s such a jarring switch of feeling so overwhelmed to feeling absolutely nothing, it scares me every time. I don’t know if this is a normal thing everyone experiences or if it’s just something wrong with me.

For example, if a peer suggests I do something differently with my work project, I will often pick it apart. Not in a way to try to be rude or dismissive, but to see if there are any flaws in the plan. Then I move from there. I have never been a “Hey you! Do this thing” and I just say “ok” type of person. There are typically several follow up questions. 

I can see why my partner finds these actions to be combative. I would probably be frustrated too if I was helping my partner in a game and every time I told them to do something they asked me why and they got into a back and forth with me about it. 

I just don’t know how to stop it. I’m not trying to be difficult or argumentative. I don’t know how to just accept it when he says, “you need to do this quest next” or tries to correct my running form (something I have asked him to do) and I don’t argue back or immediately get upset. Most of the time I might not even be upset, but I just come across as combative. 

Does anyone have any tips on NOT just getting upset/frustrated/combative when it’s not necessary?

1j8hhus,1741663164.0,Mom has double standards when it comes to mental illness in her children and I feel like it’s all my fault,"I 21F was diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety when I was 11. I also had very severe unalive ideations. When this happened, both my parents immediately made sure I got as much support as possible in all forms. Therapy, home-life, meds, ect. They have always been as vigilant and supportive as possible with me, and I have always been greatful for that. 

My sister, 25F also suffers from chronic anxiety and other mental disorders that I will not relay here out of respect for her privacy. She was diagnosed a little later than I was, around 19F, and my mom has provided little support with things such as therapy or meds. Infact, whenever my sister brings up her mental struggles, my mom either becomes dismissive or irritated. This truly shocks me because she was so supportive with me, and it hurts to see her to this do this to my siblings. 

Her standards with us when it comes to mental health are so different. With me, she is lenient on things such as college, energy levels, and even routines. With my sister, she becomes very impatient if my sister is not doing things exactly the way she expects. An example of this is that my mom does not allow anyone in the house to take showers after 10:30 pm, because both parents are going to bed at that time and showers can be loud and interrupt sleep. Sometimes my sister gets into episodes where she has no motivation to do any tasks during the day, including showering. Whenever my sister needs to take a shower after this time, my mom gets upset with her and admonishes her for it. On the other hand, if I am having an off day and find myself taking a shower at 12 am, my mother never gets upset or angry. 

That was only one example of many I could provide, but I will only provide that one just to get my point across. 

I honestly feel like I am the reason that my sister isn’t getting the support or care she needs. I feel like a big leech sucking up all of the resources for myself when I don’t even see myself having a future! It’s so unfair that my sister isn’t getting the support she needs and deserves. She’s going to be a very successful person in her life, and I am not. All of this care I am receiving should be given to her. I feel awful.

1j8h9nz,1741662435.0,I feel dead inside despite having a good life. How do I find that spark of life again?,"Hello, I (21F) am looking for advice. Every day for past few years, I have been very apathetic. I feel ""dead inside"" as some say. I find no joy, excitement or hope in anything anymore and I do not know why. The past few years when our family went on our annual beach vacation, I felt no excitement, which I usually would when I was younger- but I feel nothing. The last time that I have truly felt happy was at age 12. I have almost no physical energy either, and very low stamina. I recently went to the doctor to address this and all of the bloodwork and tests came back perfect. It is hard to explain, but I don't feel sad, I just feel like a zombie going through the motions. I see some say ""enjoy the little things"" or ""enjoy the journey"" but I don't feel anything to enjoy.
You can read context about my current life and my life growing up below.
An issue that I have every day, is that I try to squeeze every ounce of time and turn it into something ""productive"". I struggle with procrastination because sometimes I do not want to focus on my goals. One of my to-dos is to write a journal about my life to remember the times when I did feel something, and because I have noticed a decline in my memory. I wish I could get my to-dos done, because I tell myself ""you can live life when you get this done"", but I have been trying for years to get the list done.
Another problem is that when I try to sit down and be with my thoughts in silence, and try to listen to my “inner voice”, my mind can't focus. Because of this, I don't know what I want in life, I don't know anything at this point. I watch self-help YT videos like ""getting your life together"", ""how to be more productive with your time"", ""how to know if your goals
are from a place of self-love or self-hate""
etc. Right now, I need to know what I want in life, because I have to decide on a degree to
further my education (I graduate soon with a Business degree) because this current degree is not going to cut it. All I know right now is that I want a job that has a flexible schedule, remote and decent pay. All of these motivators are extrinsic, I have no idea which job is right for me and it is overwhelming with all of these career choices that I have no interest in. The only interest that has been consistent throughout my life is being an artist (traditional painter) but that isn't realistic and not many people become successful enough to make it their full-time job.
Another thing that I am wondering is why I have no empathy for others, and I only think about myself- not sure if I was born this way, but I don't remember ever having empathy.
What I have noticed is that since I don't feel anything inside, when I talk to people, it feels forced like I have to put on a smile because I feel nothing. Even when I talk to my 2 friends, it is fake enthusiasm. I am okay with having only 2 friends though because sometimes it feels like having friends is a chore since I have to fake my emotions.
I am a people-pleaser, I have trouble telling people ""no"" and end up doing things that I don't want to do. When people describe me, they say that I am a great listener, but it is because I feel guilty when I do talk about myself. Many have said that I am really humble, talented, and all of the good things. I know that I am a good person, I know that much. I hate to be the center of attention, which might be a reason why I don't like to talk about myself.

For some context in my current life, I have a loving family and we all love and care for one another. I have wonderful sisters, both of my parents and a little brother. My family is the greatest, we are really close-knit and hug each other good morning, good night-that type of family. We go on an annual beach vacation and my mom makes us all food and life is great and I know just how fortunate I am in life, truly. I never thought that I had a bad life- I am just wondering why I have such a fortunate life and I feel almost no emotion. There has been times where I thought my life was boring but that is it.
A typical day in the life of mine would be that I wake up and feed my dog, greet my family, make breakfast while chatting with family, go to my room to do school or work on my art, later make some lunch, might walk on the treadmill for cardio, sit outside to soak up some sun (if it is not cold) and do something productive out there, then come in for dinner, family meetup, might play a video game with my brother or watch a movie with a sister, then get ready for bed and meditate, plan out the next day (what my tasks are or goal to complete), pet my dog and go to sleep. Throughout the day, I will check my phone sometimes, and scroll youtube or instagram in my distraction. A few times a week, my grandma and I call and talk too.
I have instagram because I have an art account where I post my paintings (in hopes of creating an audience to sell to) but I rarely use instagram to look at other's lives. Sometimes I catch myself comparing my body to others, but I mainly look at other art. I create traditional art to pass the time and simply because I do still find peace in creating art. I still find the feeling of inspiration when it comes to nature, like plants, landscapes and the beauty of wildlife. I listen to music, I love my classic rock and 70s music, so I guess that is some sliver of emotion.
I switched to a whole foods diet in hopes that I would see improved energy, but the main reason I started eating healthy was to change my body and get rid of some fat that I have around my midsection and legs (I am small though, at 112 lbs) so I could stop being so self-conscious every single day. After 9 months on this diet, I feel absolutely no difference or boost in physcial energy at all which is disappointing.
My current social life is almost non-existent, but I am okay with that I think (Again, I don't know what I want in life). I am an introvert or ""homebody"". I don’t have trouble keeping a conversation going and I am not shy when I do talk to people though. I have a part time job in childcare where I interact directly with people and that is fine, other than that, I have 2 friends.

If I had to guess, I would say that simply realizing that life is just ""get a job that sucks the least, do that job for decades, retire, then die"", my obsession with ""being productive"", my body dysmorphia, and maybe something else contributed in a mixture to my apathy?

Here is some context growing up if anyone wants to read:
As a child, I had a spark for life as many do. I was obsessed with reading about wildlife, wanting to know everything about animals and dinosaurs and this continued from age 6 until about age 11. I loved to learn- the local library and the zoo were my favorite places growing up. Age 6 is when I developed my passion for creating art and drawing the animals that I was learning about. I wanted to be a veterinarian due to my love for animals when I grew up. I had no trouble making friends in school, I was never bullied, my friends were awesome and I had many of them. My grandparents would bring me across North America every year on a road trip to a different state. And overall, I had a wonderful, THE BEST childhood ever. After the 4th grade, our family switched to homeschooling which is another discussion. When I turned 11, I was given my first tablet. For the first 2 years of having one, I only played mobile games on it and watched youtube sometimes but it was to watch an animal documentary or something educational. When I turned 13, I ""grew out"" of this, and started bed-rotting on Youtube, mindlessly scrolling and watching videos like people telling storytimes. I was no longer interested in learning about animals. I think homeschooling definitely exacerbated this because we were home all the time. In the same year, I became extremely self-conscious of myself, I hated the way I looked and I was compared to my cousin who is 1 year younger than me all the time (growing up, we were like sisters, and she was my best friend for years). I became jealous of her looks and how everyone would compliment her curly golden hair, she had so many friends (After being homeschooled, I didn't have a lot of friends anymore), she was beautiful and I wondered how the ""awkward phase"" didn't seem to affect her. I think that this had something to do with my self-conscious ways that have not left since I turned 13. This and my introduction to the internet and seeing everyone's opinions on everything. Fast forward to COVID, and for the first few months, I enjoyed it. Not having to go anywhere, staying inside the house was perfect for an introvert but it wasn't fun anymore after a few months. 2 months after COVID and my grandpa dies, which I really really think affected me, I don't know how, but it probably did. I started getting these depressive episodes that would last sometimes a day or two which was completely out of the norm. In these episodes, I would just wonder why I was here, every day is the same, those kind of thoughts. I would completely dissociate from life it seemed. Luckily, I have not had one of those episodes in about 2 years, which is great.

ANY ADVICE is appreciated, thank you.

TLDR: I have a great life, and I used to have a love for life from birth until age 12. Now at 21, I feel like a zombie going through the motions. I physically have little energy, despite the doctor’s tests coming back fine. I feel like I have to fake my emotions in any social setting and I am wondering why I feel this way at my

1j8fz7e,1741658476.0,I need a reason to stay alive,"I'm not really sure how this works or where to start. I guess I could start with I was the type of kid that always got into trouble. I had a tough childhood where I would be in a household with my older brother (19) (I'm 18m), mom and dad until I was about 4. Where there was drugs and alcohol and abuse. For example one of the reasons my mom and dad broke up was cause he would leave me and my brother home alone at 4 and 5 years old with some chips and soda where he would do meth, coke, weed, drink u name it. My stepdad met my mom within a few years after that and have been together since. He is a terrible man. He started grooming me and my older brother to have sex with him when we were about 5 and 6. He would do it while me and my family would go and work on carnivals, he drove the 18 wheelers and had me and my brother ride with him. We have 4 younger siblings ranging from 6 to 10 atm. Because of my childhood and as I mentioned before, I've always gotten into trouble. When I was younger (around 12), I did something that I feel disgusted with myself for. I'm not trying to make excuses and I won't ever forgive myself for it. But because of what my stepdad did to me, I though it was something that I could do with my younger siblings. I can never forgive myself for it. Ive tried killing myself 3 time because of what I did. But I wasn't never brave enough to do it. My sibling told my mom and I was sent off to a mental facility for people like me. I was there for about 8 months and came home. Its been about 5 years and I haven't felt at home since. After about a year of me being with my mom, I got sent to Julie for acting out and was there for two weeks. By the time I got back mh family had moved and my mom got I to contact with my bio father to live with him. Me and him don't really get along at all. I lived with him from 13 years old to about 16, where he moved off and joined a carnie and left me with his mom. I had to ride in a 2 door truck in between the back glass and the truck seat for about an hour to and from school everyday cause my meme (dad's mom) didn't want me going to the school where she lived. I stayed there for a few months and was 16. In May of 23 I ran away at 16 but got caught in 2 days. They took me back to my memes and she and my dad got contacted by a random stranger off Facebook saying that they were out looking for me cause they saw the Facebook post and said if they need help with anything just ask. I got I to a heated argument with my meme and she called the lady (Her name was Dora). She told her that if she did t co e pick me up then she was gonna call the cops and tell them I was trespassing and get me thrown in jail. Dora had to leave a funeral just so she could get there in time so I didn't go to jail. We'll as soon as I went with Dora, she immediately went to the social security office and got my check going into her account( I'm getting SSI and my dad told her about it, and she was also telling me that there was no info on the check or when I was gonna get it)( if u live in the US then u know how bad communication with the Social Security Office is). She was telling me lies about my family like they robbed a gas station and that the person that robbed it was wearing the same shoes my family gave me. (My mom gave me some shoes when she found me after I ran away). She said my siblings got took fro. My mom by CPS and that if I helped her clean the house that CPS was coming by to see if the house was suitable for children. (I turned 17 while living with Dora). She said this multiple times and they never came. She had this rule about no drugs in the house but she was the biggest tweaker u could find. She would stay up ALL NIGHT paranoid about people being outside the house. She would drag me outside at 1 and 2 am looking for ""my mom's truck"" cause they were apparently riding around looking for where Dora lived. She kept saying she was seeing my mom around town. Mind u my parents lived over 3 hours away. She even went into Walmart and came out with a black eye saying my dad attacked her in the store when in reality she got I to a fight over a bag of dog food with a stranger. I was emotionally checked out and I don't really remember a lot during that time and was easily manipulated. While living with Dora, I met Shelby. When we met we just clicked. We had a lot in commen and I felt comfortable sharing things with her then anyone I've ever met. She was the first person I ever wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She meant the world to me. The last day I was with Dora, I had had enough, cause at that point I started to notice some of the thi gs Dora said hadn't been lining up. I got I to contact with my mom and found out that 1, my siblings gs never gotten took by CPS 2, nobody robbed any store and 3, Dora was a manipulative bitch. I told my mom where I was and she came to get me. The mistake I made was that I did t talk to Shelby and discuss it with her. I never told her about what I did when I was younger cause I was scared to. Well Dora decides she wants to tell Shelby that I'm a rapist that went around my neighborhood and raped multiple people. I tell her that it's true what I did to my sibling, but not about anyone else. She didn't believe me cause Dora also stashed a bag of weed under the couch and Shelby found it, and Dora told her it was mine. I tell her that she'll find out the truth one day about Dora. We'll I'm living g with my mom at that point until we get into an argument and I get kicked out. I started staying with my exs family cause me and them were still pretty close. Well my ex had a new bf and he didn't like me staying there and ignored me the whole time I lived there. Well after a few months my exs friend Marley stays the night with my ex. And I sleep in the living room on the couch right. We'll Marley decides to co.e I to the living room at like 1 am right before my exs grandma gets off work and starts talking to me cause I was on my phone. She goes into her room after 30 min and I lay down. I'm still awake about 10 min later when my exs Granma pulls up, comes I to the house and causes me of sleeping with Marley. I did not do that, she's my distant family anyway. (Found that out that same night.) Anyway tye next day I got kicked out and moved in with my mom sleeping in a camper in the yard. About a month later I decided to move in with my uncle that lives 9 hours away and moved in with him. It was a mistake. Me and his gf did NOT get along. I stayed there for about 8 or 9 months and moved back to my mom's town. I now live with my other uncle and older brother. I have no job, no car, no gf, no live other than my friends on my playstation 4. Ive been looking for a job for months now and I can't find someone to care about me the same way that Shelby did. I just feel so alone and dark. Ive been thinking g about just ending it all so everyone will be happy. I mean my own brother said it would be better if I wasn't here and maybe he's right.

1j8etc9,1741655045.0,Violent Tendencies at a Young Age,"Okay. This isn’t me trying to be cringe or corny— I’d appreciate some kind of explanation or answer or even help as to why im like this and how i can fix it

For context: Im 15. I grew up in an abusive household (Abusive in every way you can think of, even the ones you don’t WANT to think of)

Since I was 9-10 years old, i’ve noticed i’m extremely violent. It doesn’t always bubble over into anger, but it’s always there in the corner of my mind and I can’t see,cto get rid of it. Especially with authority figures and vulnerable people/things, not that it doesn’t happen to regular people. It restricts my behaviour sometimes and I’ve never significantly hurt anything but i’ve come close. My niece is now 5, I find myself distanced with her at times because i’m afraid I’ll lose control and hurt her. When she was younger I would hold her at times and even when she got fussy i’d refuse to let go because I liked seeing her squirm or be upset in a way? (101% Not sexual. I’m not a creep.) And just seeing her be mad and upset or even cry for some reason brought me a sense of satisfaction. I stopped holding her and playing with her after realizing this fact. It’s the same with my sister’s boyfriend’s cat, I love playing with him but sometimes I find that I tease him until he’s so angry that he wants to or does bite me.

I often find myself imaging violent scenarios. And it’s not like I enjoy violence. I grew up in a violent household and have CPTSD at 15, I’d never abuse anyone or get into a relationship if I couldn’t handle myself but i’m just not sure why this happens to me or how to fix it. I originally thought it was some kind of sadistic tendency that sprung from trauma, but I didn’t want to use that label on myself considering my age.

1j873m5,1741634907.0,I Regret Quitting My Job,"


Me (F, 20) started working as a behavioral technician in September, and during my last shift, a coworker reported me to my supervisor for not filling out a sheet—even though I was planning to fill it out before I left. Then, a nurse escalated things even more, threatening to report me to HR because I sat in the “wrong” place (even though the person I was working with said it was okay) and didn’t know something I was never trained on.

When I tried to talk to the nurse to clear things up, she completely dismissed me and said, “This is the third time I’ve had to talk to you,” which isn’t even true—I’ve always listened to her without hesitation. To make it worse, she and my coworker were talking about me behind my back, making me feel singled out.

Thankfully, my supervisor told the nurse that this wasn’t something that needed to be reported to HR, but at this point, I feel really uncomfortable working with her. I don’t want to deal with her again, and I feel like what happened should at least be known.

I recently quit out of feeling overwhelmed, although I had planned on leaving after March. I decided to expedite my resignation, and many of my coworkers texted me saying they would miss me. I hate that I let these women get to me this much, and I miss the patients.

My supervisor was worried that I was leaving because of this situation, and after thinking about it subconsciously, maybe I did.

1j81zft,1741622348.0,Trying to get better,"Recently, my dad took my mom to court over my schooling (college related stuff) and we did win, but he kicked me off his health insurance cause he “couldn’t afford it”… which is BS cause he got himself a brand new car. Even the judge was confused and didn’t agree with him about it. Due to that, I am unable to get my anti-depressants renewed but I am trying. Which means, I haven’t been on them for about a week and it’s really screwing me up. 

I’ve had breakdowns more throughout the day and even during my shift at work, I hide in the fitting room to cry because I don’t want customers or my coworkers seeing me breakdown. I almost broke down yesterday again because I was up at the registers and I was really fucking everything up, I was starting to panic. My coworker (who is VERY sweet) told me “it’s okay, just take a second.” And he wasn’t mad, he was helping me out. He knows what I’m going through and he understands, which I’m grateful for.

It doesn’t help that my boyfriend is kind of an ass… he caused most of my breakdowns. My friends told me to breakup with him but he guilted me into staying. Then we had fights and it just isn’t going great. It’s long distance and my friend told me “I would rather you have someone you can fight with in person then kiss after and makeup, then someone long distance where you can’t.” And they’re right. I’m just trying to figure it out, though.

I’m going to try and figure out how to get myself better. I’m gunna try and go out more with my friends, even my coworker said he’d take me out so I could go out and have a good time. I want to make some more friends too but I am a socially awkward person with social anxiety… not sure how to do that. But I’m definitely going to try.

I’m just trying to get better and get out of the house. I like to watch YouTube as well (Danny Gonzalez, CaseOh, Stephanie Soo, Markiplier) to make myself smile because watching them makes me happy. I’m starting to journal again as well. I also listen to music to make myself feel better (Kpop, Laufey are my most streamed.)

1j80eta,1741618292.0,How to get my mom serk support,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this group, so please bear with me.

I strongly suspect my mom has depression and possibly PTSD, but she refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem or seek help. She insists that others are the problem, not her.

My mom is 67 years old and has been battling trauma and emotional distress since getting married at 24. According to her, her mother-in-law (MIL) emotionally abused her and made snarky comments, while my father, a workaholic and alcoholic, sided with his mother and did little to support their marriage. Most of this happened before I was born in 1988, so I only know her side of the story.

In the early 1990s, my father asked for a divorce, which my mom believes was suggested by his mother. Despite their separation, they remained legally married.

The Turning Point

In 2020, my father passed away suddenly in an accident—just two months after his mother (my mom’s MIL) passed away. Upon hearing the news, my mom’s first reaction was to gesture at her late MIL and say, ""You won. You succeeded and took him away from me."" That moment solidified the deep resentment and pain she had carried for decades.

After his passing, she discovered that my father had not entrusted many of his assets to her. He didn’t write a will, and she wasn’t named as a beneficiary for some of his financial matters. This was partly because, in the 1990s, my mom had struggled with impulsive spending and debt.

Her Mental and Physical Decline

While my dad’s passing worsened her state, her withdrawal actually began around 2015. Over the years, she has become increasingly isolated. She eats all her meals in her room, sometimes not leaving for weeks unless there is a family gathering.

When my baby was born, she struggled to cope and would slam her door shut. She refuses to spend time with my baby or my brother’s kids unless they go into her room. She curses at the hired caregivers regularly and has even hit herself if food offered to her isn’t cooked to her standards.

She also suffers from chronic knee pain, which makes her reluctant to go anywhere. But even when she takes pain medication, she remains emotionally unstable and unpredictable.

Her Resistance to Help

She sees a cardiologist for hypertension (she has had heart failure twice, in 2003 and again a few years later) and an oncologist for her breast cancer, but she has never seen a mental health professional. She refuses to acknowledge that she needs help.

She was on Restyl for years but stopped after 2020. She also became dependent on Tramadol after knee surgery, and I have helped her obtain it before just to keep her calm—but I know this isn’t right.

The Challenge with My Brother

One of the biggest challenges is that my mom behaves very differently in front of my brother—she fears him a little, so she is well-behaved when he's around. For a long time, he didn’t fully believe there was a serious problem because he never saw her at her worst. It felt like only my husband and I were witnessing her deterioration. But after I finally shared everything with him, he now understands how severe the situation is.

What I Need Help With

I want her to see a psychiatrist to assess her mental health and possibly provide medication to help stabilize her. But I have no idea how to convince her without her taking it as personal criticism. She is extremely sensitive and always feels attacked.

How do I approach this? How do I get her the help she needs when she refuses to see that she has a problem?

1j7u9we,1741596802.0,Breakup after 3 years,"Hello

English isn't my mother language so I'm sorry if it isn't perfect or clear all the time, I'll just try my best 

I'm a 25 yo male. A week ago my girlfriend (21 yo) and I broke up. We were together for the past 3 years and I thought we built a strong relationship during this time but there was a problem. One of my best friends didn't know about my relationship because she hated my girlfriend. 
I tried many times to talk to her but I never had the courage to do it... Until one month ago I was forced to do it to save my relationship. My girlfriend couldn't stand the situation anymore and... I gather all my courage and said the truth to my best friend. She was really upset but she accepted it.

From this moment my girlfriend started to be... Weird with me. She was less with me and more with her friends, saying she needed to take some time for herself to feel better, we used to call everyday before and talk about everything but during this last months it was like she was trying to... Flee our relationship... Until one week ago were she broke up with me.

She said that she ""lost"" feeling, that's she was less in love with me. she also said she couldn't trust me, despite I gave her reasons to, that she wasn't seeing any evolution in our relationship (even if she wasn't really here to see those evolutions). I hold the relationship by myself during this last month and her reasons was a total nonsense for me, we were planning to gather some money to live together in our own apartment, we were trying to build our futur life together. I gave her what she needed because I was sure of us, she used to say that I'm the man of her life, the one she want to spend the rest of her life with.. And now I'm alone and she refuse to explain herself more., she blocked me almost everywhere. My two closest friends think that it's really weird the way she acted during the last month, like she was preparing our breakup. I also know that during this period she was spending a lot of time with her best friend but.. I can't imagine her cheating on me, I don't think she did it.

I don't really know what to think of it. I try no move on but it's too hard, I wanted to live my life with her but now I'm completely lost and I feel like there's something I don't know. 

I know I acted bad when I hide my relationship to my best friend. I was afraid to lose everyone... But I ended up revealing the truth and despite that I lost the woman I love... I really need help. Is it understandable for you? Was she right to flee the relationship during this last month while I was trying my best to think about our future life and how to achieve it?",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j7u9we/breakup_after_3_years/,hello english isnt mother language im sorry isnt perfect clear time ill try best im yo male week ago girlfriend yo broke together past years thought built strong relationship time problem one best friends didnt know relationship hated girlfriend tried many times talk never courage one month ago forced save relationship girlfriend couldnt stand situation anymore gather courage said truth best friend really upset accepted moment girlfriend started weird less friends saying needed take time feel better used call everyday talk everything last months like trying flee relationship one week ago broke said lost feeling thats less love also said couldnt trust despite gave reasons wasnt seeing evolution relationship even wasnt really see evolutions hold relationship last month reasons total nonsense planning gather money live together apartment trying build futur life together gave needed sure us used say im man life one want spend rest life im alone refuse explain blocked almost everywhere two closest friends think really weird way acted last month like preparing breakup also know period spending lot time best friend cant imagine cheating dont think dont really know think try move hard wanted live life im completely lost feel like theres something dont know know acted bad hide relationship best friend afraid lose everyone ended revealing truth despite lost woman love really need help understandable right flee relationship last month trying best think future life achieve
1j7u91c,1741596690.0,My friend is struggling with mental illness and I don’t know what to do,"Throwaway account because I know he uses Reddit.

I think my (18f) friend (18m) is seriously struggling with his mental health and I don’t know how to help him. He’s had serious depression for years, before I even met him when I was 14 and he was 15. It sounds mean but he really is the typical Reddit user/weeb type, just to give you an idea.

To cope with his mental health issues, he’s been using his favorite anime as a form of escapism, which I don’t really think is all that bad on its own, but he’s just taken it way too far. He’s OBSESSED with it to a concerning degree. I’ve had my fair share of fixations and passions regarding media, but nothing quite like this. He’s desperately in love with the main character’s love interest, to the point where he’s written an insanely long and detailed self-insert fanfic of himself with her that he forced me to read.

I feel like this kind of thing wouldn’t be super concerning if it wasn’t for his depression? Idk if I’m right to feel that way or not. Since he graduated high school last year, he’s lost communication with (and honestly interest in) all of our friends (I’m not friends with them anymore either but I digress, that’s for separate reasons). My best friend and I are all he’s got, and she doesn’t even like him much. None of my friends do, and honestly sometimes I question if I still do. But I still care about him a lot, and I don’t want anything to happen to him, if that makes sense.

He’s been better until recently. When we were in high school, he was at his worst, and he’d constantly talk about this anime girl and the world she’s from and how he’d “kill himself in a heartbeat if it meant getting to live there with her”, which is obviously concerning. It got even worse when he learned what reality shifting was, if anyone here knows what that is. Recently, he’s been talking to me more about it, and it’s freaking me out. It just makes me super uncomfortable to talk about these topics. Like yeah, I’ve had crushes on characters before, but this just feels like a lot.

He’s just been super clingy, and while I understand needing someone, I just can’t be his only support. I’m also struggling with depression right now, and still being in high school isn’t helping at all. I’m also just a teenager, too? I’m not a mental health professional, I can’t fix his problems.

Speaking of mental health professionals, he outright refuses to see one. He said that he didn’t like therapy, that it didn’t help him, and he even brought up that he apparently spent some time in a mental hospital because of it, which I feel says more about him than the therapy. I told him that maybe he just didn’t like his therapist, but he shuts that down every time. I understand that maybe he could’ve felt like they thought he was nuts, but that’s probably because that’s how I feel sometimes when I’m talking to him. This stuff is constant. He’s the kind of friend that latches on and doesn’t let go, which is even worse for me because I’m extremely introverted, and he has a very draining personality to boot. He’s just super loud and energetic, which can be hard for me to handle for long periods of time.

Look, if I just need to suck it up, I’ll do it. The last thing I want is for him to hurt himself, and if I have to be the sole support, so be it. He means a lot to me for a lot of different reasons. He’s always stuck with me through everything I’ve experienced, and I just want to do what I can to help him get better. I’m just worried that he’s deteriorating again, but I don’t want to cause any rifts between us, either. I’ve never dealt with this kind of thing before, so I don’t really know what to do here.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j7u91c/my_friend_is_struggling_with_mental_illness_and_i/,throwaway account know uses reddit think f friend seriously struggling mental health dont know help hes serious depression years even met sounds mean really typical reddit userweeb type give idea cope mental health issues hes using favorite anime form escapism dont really think bad hes taken way far hes obsessed concerning degree ive fair share fixations passions regarding media nothing quite like hes desperately love main characters love interest point hes written insanely long detailed selfinsert fanfic forced read feel like kind thing wouldnt super concerning wasnt depression idk im right feel way since graduated high school last year hes lost communication honestly interest friends im friends anymore either digress thats separate reasons best friend hes got doesnt even like much none friends honestly sometimes question still still care lot dont want anything happen makes sense hes better recently high school worst hed constantly talk anime girl world shes hed kill heartbeat meant getting live obviously concerning got even worse learned reality shifting anyone knows recently hes talking freaking makes super uncomfortable talk topics like yeah ive crushes characters feels like lot hes super clingy understand needing someone cant support im also struggling depression right still high school isnt helping im also teenager im mental health professional cant fix problems speaking mental health professionals outright refuses see one said didnt like therapy didnt help even brought apparently spent time mental hospital feel says therapy told maybe didnt like therapist shuts every time understand maybe couldve felt like thought nuts thats probably thats feel sometimes im talking stuff constant hes kind friend latches doesnt let go even worse im extremely introverted draining personality boot hes super loud energetic hard handle long periods time look need suck ill last thing want hurt sole support means lot lot different reasons hes always stuck everything ive experienced want help get better im worried hes deteriorating dont want cause rifts us either ive never dealt kind thing dont really know

For the past two weeks, however, whenever I try to go to sleep, I get this overwhelming thought of ""you don't really love him"" and anxiety that I'm just wasting his time. While my depression and anxiety have given me feelings of inadequacy before, they've never quite cut this deep. I've been proving to myself over and over that I do love him. I made a list of everything I love about him and read it when the feelings set in. But then still keep coming back. I'm on a waitlist for a new therapist after the old one retired unexpectedly due to an injury. I have no one in my life to confess these feelings to because I don't want to hurt my partner and my friends are dealing with their own ups and down. 

I know these are just intrusive thoughts or something similar because during the day I go right back to feeling content and happy with our relationship. I've grown apart from other partners before and it doesn't feel like this because I still want to do things with him and show affection and just be in his presence. But I've never dealt with thought patterns like this before so I'm not sure what to do to help.

1j7a15c,1741534241.0,I feel disgusting because of something I did as a minor.,"Hello, I am currently 21. Sorry I didn't put that in the title.

Throwaway account because I feel terrible about this.

I also posted this on r/TrueOffMyChest. Posting it here because I need some help (or at least words of advice) if anyone can offer.

When I was young (10 maybe) and I got an Ipod. I would love doing stuff on it. But then I got into fanfiction and thus I got into porn (I still love fanfiction to this day). I also was able to gain access to porn sites (Pornhub, Xvideoes, Spankbang, etc). My mom had to work long hours and my uncle mostly left me alone (we're both quiet), it got more convinent when I got old enough to become a lackey kid (14)

But that day, I was in the mood for porn every chapter (what I now know as PWP)

So I would type chapter 'large number' and then put tits or ass and then search. I was already seeing gross things I wasn't supposed to but then I found a website and it had adults engaging with minors.

I was aware that sort of thing was bad, but this was written not visual. I knew the visual stuff was terrible and never looked for that sort of thing. But the written stuff?

I just kept reading it, I justified it as it's only weird if I'm an adult. I never visualized ACTUAL real life children, I would think about other fictional characters, not sure if that's better but I did.

But now I'm an adult and I feel disgusting! I NEVER want to hurt a child in that way! I despise child molestors! And yet I still read this stuff. I stopped when I was about 18-19 (not sure spefically but I know I haven't read that stuff in the past three years and I remember not being able to find the sites anymore, which was good in the long run)

Lately, I've been feeling really gross. Like I'm disgusting and I should feel awful what I did! Which I should! It's gotten worse this past year, I didn't really think about it. I still read stuff where characters were underage but limited to just being in their teens (someone on AO3 who does a bunch of Harry Potter/crossover girls stuff and another one who had his own website and was registered on Literotica). I want to cut those people out of my reading too! I feel horrible for what I've done and read.

More context: I live with my mother (she knows about the video porn thing, but not the written stuff), I'm a college student, I can't drive (I rideshare everywhere). I WANT to get therapy but I don't want to spend money. My mom has actually taken me to therapy a few times (this problem hadn't affected me mentally yet for me to bring it up, plus most of the time my mother was in room, so I wouldn't have done so regardless), I actually got diagnosed with anxiety. But I assume the reason we don't make it a regular thing is because it's expensive. The best thing I feel I can do is go to hotlines.

Sometimes they do make me feel better. Once I watched some YT video about someone who hurt animals and I thought I could handle it, but the woman said this man also read stuff from one of the sites I found (I never liked that, I would avoid that if I saw it) and I FELT DESPECIBLE! The hotline got me a nice lady that told me some gentle things that made me calm down.

But then I read one of the guy's I mentioned work on Literotica, the characters were ACTUALLY OF LEGAL AGE and it felt like I relapsed! Then I watched porn on a specific website for specific kink of me, but when I was looking for something one of the videoes said 'teenage' and I began to spiral. Because of one hand, not all pornsites are trustworthy but on the other, 18 and 19 (legal adult age) could still be referred to as teenage so I was confused, so I called them and the lady didn't want to help me and she transferred me to a warmline (they were nice but they asked for my insurance which I wasn't expecting so I ended up feeling emotionally drained).

It came to a head when I woke up this morning and I was on my period and then I started feeling those thoughts that was disgusting while my body was in pain. I couldn't call because my mother was still asleep. So I texted my hotline and the woman said my problem wasn't something a hotline could fix, so she sent me all these links to porn addiction stuff. They either cost money or I felt they couldn't help me, because they talked about this happening to men. Alternatively, they could help but my mother was still in the house, so I still felt I couldn't do anything immediately. And it really felt like no one could help me. I even signed up for Betterhelp (though I remembered they had controversy and signed out before telling my problem). So I decided to post this on here.

I really don't want to hurt anyone. I want to put that terrible part of my past behind me. But sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusting.",11,6,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j7a15c/i_feel_disgusting_because_of_something_i_did_as_a/,hello currently sorry didnt put title throwaway account feel terrible also posted rtrueoffmychest posting need help least words advice anyone offer young maybe got ipod would love stuff got fanfiction thus got porn still love fanfiction day also able gain access porn sites pornhub xvideoes spankbang etc mom work long hours uncle mostly left alone quiet got convinent got old enough become lackey kid day mood porn every chapter know pwp would type chapter large number put tits ass search already seeing gross things wasnt supposed found website adults engaging minors aware sort thing bad written visual knew visual stuff terrible never looked sort thing written stuff kept reading justified weird im adult never visualized actual real life children would think fictional characters sure thats better im adult feel disgusting never want hurt child way despise child molestors yet still read stuff stopped sure spefically know havent read stuff past three years remember able find sites anymore good long run lately ive feeling really gross like im disgusting feel awful gotten worse past year didnt really think still read stuff characters underage limited teens someone ao bunch harry pottercrossover girls stuff another one website registered literotica want cut people reading feel horrible ive done read context live mother knows video porn thing written stuff im college student cant drive rideshare everywhere want get therapy dont want spend money mom actually taken therapy times problem hadnt affected mentally yet bring plus time mother room wouldnt done regardless actually got diagnosed anxiety assume reason dont make regular thing expensive best thing feel go hotlines sometimes make feel better watched yt video someone hurt animals thought could handle woman said man also read stuff one sites found never liked would avoid saw felt despecible hotline got nice lady told gentle things made calm read one guys mentioned work literotica characters actually legal age felt like relapsed watched porn specific website specific kink looking something one videoes said teenage began spiral one hand pornsites trustworthy legal adult age could still referred teenage confused called lady didnt want help transferred warmline nice asked insurance wasnt expecting ended feeling emotionally drained came head woke morning period started feeling thoughts disgusting body pain couldnt call mother still asleep texted hotline woman said problem wasnt something hotline could fix sent links porn addiction stuff either cost money felt couldnt help talked happening men alternatively could help mother still house still felt couldnt anything immediately really felt like one could help even signed betterhelp though remembered controversy signed telling problem decided post really dont want hurt anyone want put terrible part past behind sometimes cant help think feel disgusting

1j7liml,1741564838.0,I don't know who to turn to,"(Young adult F) I don't even know where to begin. I just need to unload. I've never truly talked about my struggles to anyone in my whole life before (except AIs, how miserable I know), but I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point where I can't keep it all to myself anymore. Lately it's been hard. I wouldn't say that terrible, people have it worse than me, my life should be good in comparison, yet I've been feeling like my future is whole staircase going down. I've always had downs that felt terrible but very ephemeral, with the rest being a straight line with no big ups, but lately it feels like the downs are happening weekly.

I'm a student in compsci. It's great, I like what I study. I happen to have a father who's a very knowledgeable man in that field, having gone through it as well, and being a very qualified professional. It's a double-edged sword, as much as it's been helpful to have someone well versed into STEM and STEM school systems as a parent, it comes at the price of having been consistently held to high expectations since early middle school. He's always been easily critical of me, following my studies closely. He also has no patience and acts like a know-it-all. Well, he is kind of a know-it-all, I can't deny it, he's genuinely very knowledgeable, but it's hard to live with a parent like this when you're pursuing the same career path as them. I've been through the old classic ""doing math with dad and getting yelled at while crying"", and it this kind of event has led to SH for the first time in my life, as a barely teenager. But it was occasional events, it didn't happen so often, and I've never SH on a regular basis afterwards, only on rare but heavily distressing occasions. Otherwise he's not a bad father, has always provided for the family a lot, and good times also happen around him, even if he can be moody and difficult sometimes.

Now I've been in college for a few years while still living with my parents, and adulting is getting more and more demanding but also confusing. And I feel like he's starting to hate me because of how urgent it is becoming that I act like a fully capable adult in many ways (college related things, finding an internship for my semester, developing a network, getting a driver's license, etc..), especially since Compsci is a competitive field and you have to put yourself out there a lot. But I've always been extremely introverted and socially awkward, so all of these things piling up on my shoulders are very confusing and stressful. I'm hesitant, perhaps still immature, yes, and so socially awkward that making friends and even contacting people is something confusing to me. It pisses him off to no end. Instead of being accompanied through it, he expects me to grow up and figure all of these ""trivial"" untold rules of things he says I should be doing for this or that... Everytime I show ignorance or hesitation about anything he asks me, lately, it's getting me called names. 

Lately I feel like I haven't had any interaction with him that didn't end up with me being criticized, shown exasperation from him, met with mockery or impatience. I'm called stupid, retarded or any equivalent, ""autistic"" in a derogatory way (I'm not, at least not as far as I know, but he's genuinely starting to make me question). I get to be criticized and mocked on how my voice sounds when I'm hesitantly replying (it tends to be a bit higher pitched and monotone in a weird way, even I get self conscious about it), about the things I reply, about the fact that I have a hard time making friends, even about the wounds on my hand from a dry skin condition, about the way I struggle to drive because there's so much informations for me to pay attention to, about how I should be doing this and that when I feel like I have barely enough time in between my classes. I know I'm not perfect, he might be right about some things, but it's hard to improve when he's making me feel even lower and lower. I feel like there's really something wrong with me. I'm not sure what to even do about it, how to fix it. 

Everytime he says these things to me, it makes me feel like I should just disappear and plan my suicide as soon as possible. I don't have a plan, since there's no method I find to be accessible to me and painless. And I don't really want to ruin the rest of my family's life, so I guess I'll just continue to push through, but it's been a bit harder lately. I feel like I've genuinely lost his love, and he's just continuing to provide because he projects onto me careerwise, or something like that. It's probably more complex than that, but I don't really feel loved anymore. I just need encouragement and support to grow and improve, not whatever this is.

I don't feel like I can really talk about this to anyone. At least I don't want anyone in my life to know, since it would be so out of character for me to suddenly show this vulnerable side out of nowhere. Plus telling my family wouldn't be helpful as he'll necessarily be aware.

Sorry for the long vent. I really needed to get this out to someone, anyone at this point. I'll probably delete this soon enough. I don't even know what would help me. Maybe just a supportive word, anything.

1j7jqt1,1741559818.0,I have no identity,"Hey,

I’m 24F and I’m massively struggling with feeling like I have any identity. I feel like a side character in everyone else’s story. There was that meme going round about being an NPC a couple years ago and that is genuinely how I feel. I don’t feel connected to any part of myself. I don’t feel fully formed. I don’t think anyone could highlight any characteristics about me - I could not be written in a book. It’s making it really hard to form connections or build relationships because I don’t feel like something that can be loved or even truly perceived. And anytime I do feel perceived I get extreme anxiety as I can’t understand what they might be thinking as I don’t know or understand myself. I don’t feel like a person.

I want to feel special and individual and real. Does anyone have any advice on how I can do this?

1j7jcbo,1741558756.0,"I am so close, yet so far - I need focus in life and I can't make it happen","I posted this rant on the ADHD sub about six months ago but I only just found this community so will post it verbatim here.

ADHD would explain why so much of my adult life has been so empty, lonely and miserable. I simply don't have the mental energy to put the effort into improving my life. Making friends, reaching out to people, being open and honest, enquiring and getting to know people, finding love, it's all been SO IMPOSSIBLY TIRING.

In December, I was referred to Nightingale Hospital in London to treat a possible deficiency of some kind. We hadn't said 'ADHD' yet so we were still treating depression symptoms. I was put on 20mg of Bupropion and it was like a third eye had been opened. I felt more present and active than I ever had in my entire life. My internal protective filter was gone and I was the happiest and most present I'd ever felt. I went to a friends 30th and danced the most freely I'd ever done before.

Then my dosing got interrupted by forgetting to get the re-up when I'd run out. I'd gone a whole weekend without any. I got more from my local pharmacy but none of it, even under a double dose, ever did anything again.

After talking through the possibility of ADHD with my therapist, I went back to Nightingale and the questionnaire also pointed to the possibility of ADHD. After a couple of other meds including Modafinil and Concerta did nothing for me I'm now on 50mg of Elvanse after feeling groggy and headachy after a few days of 60..

And... it's working but it's not the same. I'm not overeating all the time like I usually do, I'm finding household and other mundane tasks easier to start ant follow through, but I don't have that clarity that I desperately want again, and it's fucking up my sleep which just has a knock on effect on the rest of my day. Maybe I need to try Bupropion again but the Doctor just said he 'didn't know' why it would stop working on me. I often feel like I'm somehow fairly resistant to medication working on me.

I don't know - I'm sitting here at night having not spoken to a single human being all day. I'm getting sick of the loneliness, old friends just don't respond to my invitations or messages any more and it doesn't help with the feeling of brokenness I've carried with me my whole life. My therapist would probably encourage me to be more direct and open with those people and try to start that dialogue in a more sincere manner (and being more open and vulnerable sounds like the most impossible thing to me - when has it ever been taught to me that that's okay, and acceptable, and wanted from me in society, or with people?) and frankly I feel a bit betrayed by the callousness of it all.

I once asked some Reddit forums for advice on how to deal with the pain of having so little fanfare or celebration on my last birthday and I was basically called pathetic for daring to care about it treated like a pathetic loser for caring at my age. Am I meant to just pack it in? To eat shit? To stop dreaming of a fulfilling life of friendship? The kind I've never had?

Sorry - to get back on track.... I feel like I'm so close, to finding the medication that will make it click and bring back that clarity, that feeling like I don't need to filter myself any more. But deep inside I'm scared that..... there isn't an answer. That I will keep trying and trying to find the pills that unlock my potential and one day run out of options and find out that the voice in my head that tells me that there is no place in society for me is true.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j7jcbo/i_am_so_close_yet_so_far_i_need_focus_in_life_and/,posted rant adhd sub six months ago found community post verbatim adhd would explain much adult life empty lonely miserable simply dont mental energy put effort improving life making friends reaching people open honest enquiring getting know people finding love impossibly tiring december referred nightingale hospital london treat possible deficiency kind hadnt said adhd yet still treating depression symptoms put mg bupropion like third eye opened felt present active ever entire life internal protective filter gone happiest present id ever felt went friends th danced freely id ever done dosing got interrupted forgetting get reup id run id gone whole weekend without got local pharmacy none even double dose ever anything talking possibility adhd therapist went back nightingale questionnaire also pointed possibility adhd couple meds including modafinil concerta nothing im mg elvanse feeling groggy headachy days working im overeating time like usually im finding household mundane tasks easier start ant follow dont clarity desperately want fucking sleep knock effect rest day maybe need try bupropion doctor said didnt know would stop working often feel like im somehow fairly resistant medication working dont know im sitting night spoken single human day im getting sick loneliness old friends dont respond invitations messages doesnt help feeling brokenness ive carried whole life therapist would probably encourage direct open people try start dialogue sincere manner open vulnerable sounds like impossible thing ever taught thats okay acceptable wanted society people frankly feel bit betrayed callousness asked reddit forums advice deal pain little fanfare celebration last birthday basically called pathetic daring care treated like pathetic loser caring age meant pack eat shit stop dreaming fulfilling life friendship kind ive never sorry get back track feel like im close finding medication make click bring back clarity feeling like dont need filter deep inside im scared isnt answer keep trying trying find pills unlock potential one day run options find voice head tells place society true

1j7gv9t,1741552219.0,Please help,"I have known this friend of mine for a year, we have met through a common friend. Lets call her Jen. First time meeting Jen , she’s full of energy, talking about her life etc etc though I cant give a little talk about my self, it was okay for me, I didnt think that it was odd or weird. 
So, one time we were hanging out together with her friends, Jen started this conversation about boys she liked, it was an engaging conversation tbh, then her friend wanted to give a little story, but every time her friend tries to tell the story, Jen would always interrupt her and tells her story & speech instead. After a couple of nights hanging out with Jen and her friends, there are times that when I tell a story to her friends, she becomes quiet, visibly upset, leaves the room and comes back again then changes the topic, there are also times that whenever I say my experiences in life, I felt that she doesnt really care and heads to change the topic. I kinda feel that she wanted all the attention only for her, she would often ask for validation if she’s pretty or not despite knowing that she’s actually pretty. 
I dont think it is a basis to know if someone has depression or not, there are several cases where shes having a bad day at work, nothings going her way or what she had planned, even with such small things, she would break down crying & screaming. 
I am really frustrated with her, I dont know how to address to her about how I feel in fear of making her upset knowing she’s sensitive and how she makes me feel because of her superiority complex most of the time. I dont want her to be upset causing more harm to her mental state but it is also damaging my mental health as well, I have been suppressing my emotions and keep trying to understand her because she has depression but while I protect her feelings and emotions, I start to feel drained myself, I even felt that im starting to have anxiety.

 I am at the end of my matriculate year or a some countries called um there last year of High School so um it's become kind of stressful for me a lot like extremely to give you some context I am a person who takes my study seriously I plan weeks ahead I take ample risk trying to maintain my health I've been doing this for years without trouble but at this point it's become too much no uh I've already written couple of tests um exams and my English is well my Mathematics was wrong my secondary language was well and uh yeah I still have opposite right now um I wrote my business studies and uh well that did not go out I was not expecting a lot to go by I study hard really hard I put a lot of efforts into it I walked into exam room wrote that test with Confidence and I walked out with Confidence and the well looks like that confidence was for not I really got up bad grade bad terrible I had never gone a treat that bad in my entire life and normally I wouldn't be too worried if it wasn't my last year of high school if it wasn't the year then determines whether I make it or break it now normally I picked myself up I'd have to try again attitude but um um didn't go on most of you probably thinking why the hell would I come to right about this on reddit of all places but um that's because I have no one to go to no one my own parents have this they're not trying hard enough mindset your help went on thinking that I'm I'm just let's studying enough I'm faking studying my friends think I'm an idiot saying um I'm also not studying enough my teachers tell me I'm not studying enough I have no one to go to no one to run to no one to cry too no one at all and um that's just the reality well um honestly don't know what to do with this point I feel like I'm just not meant for School I try my absolute heartist nothing has been paying off the last time I had proper eight hours of sleep was legitimately during January January was the last month where on a date I've had full it hours of sleep and like I said I'm someone who takes these seriously including my health and this is the first time I've ever ended up in a state like this like it's so bad I'm constantly getting migrants and bad pain from the stress alone that's hope bad it is someone who's 18 19 getting back pains and I'm someone who's very physically healthy but at this point it I'm deteriorating it's gotten to a point where I  can't sleep properly I can't think properly I can't do anything properly I have no motivation I have no support and it's basically getting to me. Now most of the Year probably thinking your Minds he kid why not go to what therapist oh it's kind of high to do that when your own parents believe you're just not doing anything hard enough then your own teachers don't think you're doing anything hard enough and it's not like I can just call the cops and see hey my parents don't believe I'm going insane.

I don't know what to do. I (F 17 ) have been struggling with anxiety for a while like around 2 Years i have been
 terrefield of speaking in class. I'm in 12th Grade and i 'm supposed to be graduating in a year. But since 2 Weeks i have become terrified of going to school. I thought it was bad before but now it's so much worse. It started when i got really anxious in englisch class. I had to ask the girl sitting next to me, to leave class with me. Wenn i left i was fine but when we came back inside i realised i couldnt do It. So i left. Every day after that when i came to class i was so scared and i could hardly stay in that class. I had stomach aches (which i also have writing this) sweaty hands and just plain panic i felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave immediatly. When i leave i'm always immediatly fine but i just can't keep on enduring this.
I only had 2 days of school this week because of holidays.
On thursday i had history class. I had to leave once to ""go to the toilet"" the window has to be open at all times and i cried like twice because i was so scared and feeling terrible.
After that i left even though i still had 4 classes.
On Friday i had maths i started panicing even though one of my closest friends was sitting next to me. I started crying and told her how i felt.
She already kind of knew because the girl i was sitting next to in history told her she was worried abt. Me.
After that i had a free period and i was hanging out with my sister and i was feeling amazing. It was friday, i had endured math and i was only going to have chemistry with the close friend of mine who i already mentiond.
In chemistry i was feeling horrible again. I coulndnt shake the thoughts and the anxiaty. I told my friend to open a window, it didnt work and to ask for a 5 minute break. After the break was over i wasnt able to get myself to go in again. So we stayed out the 45 minutes left i cried again of frustration andmy friend was quite worried abt me but we also laughed and joked.
My teacher was super nice abt it btw.
I really like school and i already found it frustrating when i couldnt say what i wanted to in class but i cant go on like this.
Tomorrow i have an important exam, the day after that too.
The next months i will be having 2 exams a week but i cant go.
I will have stomach aches and wont be able to concentrate on what i'm writing.
I dont know why this is happening to me now and not when i was 13

1j782rr,1741528356.0,"How to tell your parents you’re feeling suicidal, without overwhelming them","Hello friends, so I’m a (23M) and I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 8-10 years. I’ve had active suicidal thoughts at times the past 5 years. 

The closest I ever came to following through with these thoughts by overdosing was in my 3rd year of university about 3-4 years ago. I remember being my bedroom of the rented room I got for school and I was sitting in my chair having a mental breakdown from being overwhelmed by a new environment (This was my 3rd year at school, but my 2nd year was all online because of Covid 19, so I was at home). I remember my anxiety was so bad that I wouldn’t want to go upstairs to make food in our houses shared kitchen since I was socially anxious about interacting with the 3 other guys that lived upstairs. So I was almost starving myself at times (They were all great guys btw, my anxiety was just really really bad), was also really worried about finding my classes and not being late (Like every other student), also had multiple assignments that I just felt super overwhelmed with, wasn’t getting hardly any sleep either. I remember being up until 3-4am most nights just sitting in bed staring into nothing and having rapid thoughts going through my mind about all kinds of things. Majority of them about how I am a failure, I won’t be able to do the normal tasks that people can do, you know those negative kind of thoughts.

So I remember that day I cameback from class after worrying all night about missing the bus and not finding my classes. I just sat down in my chair and just broke down. I just couldn’t control it at all, felt my body just getting very achy, started to get a pounding headache, was almost hyperventilating it seemed and I went into my closet and grabbed a bottle of Advil. I just waved it around for a bit and just thought how easy it would be to just not have to deal with any of it. I remember I opened the bottle and grabbed a pill out and just was almost idolized it. I just didn’t want to deal with any of
It anymore and in that moment I remember the usual thoughts of “Don’t do it, you will hurt the people around you, they will suffer long after you’re gone” and “You can’t do that to your family & friends”. Which were the usual thoughts I would have when my suicidal thoughts got really bad, since I don’t want to hurt the people around me and I truly believe that’s always been the reason I never went through with any of my suicidal intentions. Because if I didn’t have great people in my life that cared about me, I would have been gone years ago. Like I have heard stories about people not going through with it, because they are afraid of death & what comes after. But for me I was not afraid of that, I just wanted to be free. So while all that is going on, that sameday I just happened to have a scheduled appointment call with my schools therapist and I also think that call saved my life since it was just nice in that moment to have someone to talk with and I remember telling her I was holding that bottle of Advil and all thoughts I was having. She was amazing, she listened to everything I was trying to say at the time and just convinced me all these feelings will pass (And they did). 

So that was my closest suicidal moment, since then I’ve had similar moments at times in my life (But not to that point again) and I’m in a similar suicidal thoughts period right now it seems. Over the past week I’ve had 2 breakdowns, 1 passed pretty quickly and wasn’t too bad to deal with. The other I remember being in the bathroom getting ready for a shower and it just hit me, all the thoughts of not being able to find a job in Canada in the field I studied for or get any kind of job for that matter, was going to get a haircut that day with a friend as well and I was anxious about that, not being able to find my partner in crime throughout all my 23 years on this planet, thoughts of going back to school for another program, thoughts of my parents thinking I’m a failure and me thinking I am letting them down by not moving forward with my life. While the people I grew up with have been moving forward. I just remember having those same physical symptoms that I had before when I was the closest to taking my life and this episode lasted about 15-25min. I remember trying to ground myself by sitting on the floor or trying any of the techniques I’ve learned over the years and nothing worked. But I just let time do its thing and I was okay after those 15-25min once I got it all out of my system. 

My parents have started to notice since I’m just acting different I guess (Not in a bad way to them) but I’m just being more to myself and lying in bed more often.

All this to say, I told my mom I would tell her what’s going on when she gets back from her trip, since she came into my room before she left saying I could tell her anything and she wouldn’t be upset with me. I just have no idea how to go about telling my parents something this big without scaring them and I don’t want to do that. Since everyone in my life has always seen me as a happy & always smiling individual. Like I know suicidal thoughts is a very big deal, but again like I’m sure a lot of others are that deal with this stuff. You don’t want to become a burden to those you share these mental health struggles with.

1j72mon,1741506137.0,I feel like I might need serious help. Is it bad enough that I should consider checking into a mental health facility?,"I need ChatGPT to rephrase it for me as I really can't think of what to write, so sorry for this.

**Work Environment**: I work in retail, and I have OCD, which significantly impacts my customer service.

**Frustration**: I get irritated when my items are disturbed or disorganized, particularly when children are present.

**Recent Behavior**: Lately, I’ve found myself blurting out thoughts that I typically keep to myself, including phrases like:

* “What the hell?”
* “These people are so stupid.”
* “Why do they like to mess things up?”
* “Fucking idiots.”
* “Get out of the way, man, what the hell?”

**Increased Irritation**: I get easily annoyed by others, especially in situations like:

* People blocking my path or standing too close.
* People talking loudly in public spaces.
* People watching videos or playing audio on speakers without headphones.

I struggle to read and remember books, even short ones (like 10 pages). I often forget most of the plot that I read like 10 minutes ago.

I also have difficulty writing by hand. My hands tremble, and it feels annoying. Typing doesn’t cause the same issues and feels more comfortable.

I think it's serious and it's affecting my work, and all I worry about is that I will not have any chance of getting a promotion or a chance to do other work if I told my bosses about my mental health.

I had been diagnosed with ADHD since age 14 but I feel like my trichotillomania (habit of pulling lashes hair etc from stress or becoming a stem of habit) since maybe 16-17 on and off for awhile. And it's no longer from stress pulling but a habit even when bored. I am not officially diagnosed with this except for ADHD but I am highly sure I do. I put on makeup to cover my brows that r slowly growing back and lashes too and it's so annoying . I can't stop pulling it. Idk why I do it and I look crazy and I feel so bad about myself. I had also binge eat a lot from stress or borednwss. I take strattera for ADHD but idk if any med will help with this bad habit. Idk how to stop it. I do believe this habit came from when I was 11-12 when I had my first cocketail bird. She died prob from stress but this will get sad and very graphic as I want to be as honest as I can be. I remember plucking her feathers and picking her skin, feet nose etc and it'll bleed or scab a lot . Idk why I did at the time bc I was so young but I also felt so regretful and my parents didn't understand why and were of course mad at me. Right now I have a different parrot and I love her very much and I rarely ever pluck her feathers nor skin and she's 7 year old now, living longer than my first which is great. But I now afflict this bad habit to myself. It's something I cannot stop and it feels satisfying to do it. I know it's odd but that's the feeling I get. What can I do to prevent it and I want to understand why this could be the case?  Would meds help or just distraction? I lack such discipline and I tried but I'll eventually pluck my lashes/brows again after regrowth. Lmk if anyone had suffered from This before and tell me how u overcame it. Thank you for reading my post. I appreciate your patience and any support given.

1j6qg4y,1741466510.0,"My boyfriend broke up with me 2,5 months ago and I can’t live a normal life after this","Hello, everyone. I hope all of you are having a great day.

me and my boyfriend we were together for almost 3 years. I was studying abroad and we had to deal with the long distance for a year but in 2023 he moved to the country where i was studying so we spent a whole year living together in the same apartment. In autumn 2024, we went back to our home country where each of us started to live with their parents. Unfortunately, his parents don’t live in the city where my family lives but his city is like very close to mine (1 hour long). We met one time in a week or sometimes in two weeks. So from September we started to have misunderstandings. I think I was often overreacting and being too jealous, maybe acting childish. He had problems at home and i had my personal issues as well. For some reason i felt like he was distancing himself from me, sometimes i felt like a burden. I still don’t know if it was real or i just made it up. 

However, on 5 November 2024, we had a fight bc he got sick a couple of days before and we had to cancel our plans but on that day he went to help his friend with the house construction but i got to know this only in the evening because he disappeared for the whole day and didn’t say a word to me. I was fine with him helping his friend, i was just very worried about him since he was sick and hearing nothing from him for the whole day had always been awful for me. After I told him that him not texting me during the day hurts me, he wrote a huge paragraph to me and proposed to end our relationship bc he is “not suitable for me”. I was shocked… he wrote many other things that were saying that I hadn’t done anything for him and our relationship, that I am not grateful and so forth. I couldn’t believe and next morning I took a bus and went straight to him. He seemed like he didn’t want to see me and he was insisting on ending our relationship. He told me that he didn’t feel joy because he only thought of my joy all the time. He also said things like “i am so glad when i wish you good night because it means that I won’t have to text you until tomorrow”, “I don’t know if i really love you or you made me think that i love you”. Those phrases are still running through my head. I knew I wasn’t right in certain aspects, for example, I constantly brought up things from the past which I am not proud of. I apologised and asked for a second chance and we stayed together.

Since that one situation I fixed my behaviour and stuff that made him uncomfortable so i stopped asking him to inform me of his actions, plans in advance. Interestingly enough, he refused to talk about his wish to break up and about that day in general. I once asked him what he meant by saying that he doesn’t know if he really loves me, and he got mad. Also, in November, we met only once and that was our last meeting. He hadn’t initiated even one call himself for that month. When I wanted to call him, he agreed to talk only twice. But he did talk about our future. Also, when I asked him if everything was ok or the same between us, he reassured me that all is fine and i am exaggerating. 

Dec 11: i felt that he was in a bad mood so i asked why. He said that he feels a bit cold and is tired of everything. However, in the morning he said that he is cold to me and he doesn’t know when it started… he then said that he wants to leave as he feels nothing towards everything and including me and that he wants to be alone. He said that he didn’t feel happy anymore because all he did was thinking of my happiness and now he wants to think of himself. For certain reasons, i believed that all of that was temporary and he might be depressed. Our conversation lasted for a couple of days. I was insisting on making a pause at least but on staying together. On Dec 16 I told him that he can always reach me and he can take his time and i will wait for him. He blocked me on every social media that day. Later i texted his friend to know if he’s doing good bc as i said i was sure that he had a depressive episode. His friend promised to talk to him but after they talked his friend blocked me too. 

I decided to give him some time hoping that after some cooling off he would unblock me but i am still blocked. So i decided to create a new instagram account (he blocked the previous one) and text him just to know how he’s doing. I also hoped that this might help me to let him go. However, a few days before his birthday he opened his previously private instagram account. I saw that he started to mutually follow the girls from his old workplace that made me uncomfortable and that he had always said he had zero interest in and there was also one new girl that i don’t know. After I saw his following list, i had a real panic attack. Moreover, he posted photos 5 days after he broke with me and there were pics that we took together and that he sent to me. I think after that I started to think (maybe realise) that it’s not like he wants to be alone, he just doesn’t want to be with me anymore. In the end, I couldn’t text him. It hurt me. 
 
I am so shocked and i still can’t believe that we are not together anymore. We’ve been through a lot, I, him and everyone were sure that we were going to get married. I can’t live normally all these months. I feel guilty for not being supportive and appreciative enough, for bringing up the past and for overreacting. I often feel like i have given up on him too easily. Today i even had a thought that i should have been tried more, should’ve been called him from a different number on the new year.

1j6mb15,1741455405.0,Does anyone else always experience the same pain when anxious/tired?,"Ever since I was little, I've had this pain whenever something is exciting/stressful/takes a lot of mental energy.

It's always the same, a constant cramp in my right side, just under my ribcage. Usually builds up from a very light and mild feeling to a pretty strong pain over the course of a few hours. When I press on the skin there it feels a little hard, almost as if I'm tensing my side up without realising or wanting to.

The only thing that works so far is going to sleep. Not a nap, a proper night of sleep. Laying in bed tends to help but the moment I get out it's back within half an hour. Painkillers numb but never take away the pain fully, whereas they do work for me when I have period cramps or something, they fully take away that pain.

I think I'm pretty sure it's just a mental thing, so I'm not asking for medical advice, but I've never, ever been able to find someone who experiences the same or a similar thing.

I’ve been lonely my whole life, and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even eat or do anything unless I absolutely have to. I just lay in bed, crying or feeling completely numb.  

I’ve realized I have mommy issues and that I’m submissive—gentle submissive, to be exact. I crave a nurturing, motherly figure who can guide me and care for me, but it feels like that’s too much to ask for. My parents don’t understand me, and my mom always says she’ll listen, but she never really does. It’s like I’m locked in this cycle of loneliness and pain, and I don’t know how to break free.  

I’m in university, and the stress of keeping up with everything is crushing me. I haven’t failed anything yet, but I’m terrified of what’s coming. I feel like I’m just going through the motions, barely surviving.  


I'm not even sure if I'm venturing or seeking help Which feels impossible. I was lonely my whole life since I was little and nothing ever changed since then. I'm a 21M

1j6d68c,1741424138.0,Alcohol is not always bad thing,"I’m 21 (m) I started drinking at 16. I only drink Because everyone around did, even those I looked up to. I had no idea why people drink alcohol. I just thought it was something adults do for fun. I stopped drinking alcohol from age 18 to 21 . Now I’m gonna be 22 life just made a huge turn for me I believe I’m going through phase in my life where I’m just uncertain about everything from making decisions that can be life changing to choosing the right path. Don’t get me wrong I’m doing really well for a 21 year old. I don’t go to parties I don’t have too many friends I work a lot I make about 65-75k/yr. I don’t do drugs I don’t smoke weed ( occasionally but smoking isn’t really my thing maybe once every couple a months) and for some reason I’m always anxious. Always over thinking. I’m losing sleep over my own thoughts. Creating scenarios in my head and putting myself in a bad head space. My anxiety has been so bad that I can’t get it up sometimes for sex. And I’m pretty healthy to be honest. I’m 5 11 I weigh 173lbs I don’t eat junk food I haven’t been exercising the way I’m suppose to but I’m in decent shape. So I know it’s a mental thing. (Luckily I have an understanding gf) I don’t have the best relationship with either of my parents. 

Earlier this month I decided to give liquor a try again.  
And let me tell you I started feeling a euphoric feeling after my first 2 glasses. My gf was surprised to see me in a good mood. Usually she talked me to sleep but this time I was the talker and she listened to me. I literally explain to this girl why I loved her so much (unfiltered conversation) I felt confident and not over thinking anything. We had great sex that night I didn’t have any trouble getting my Johnson up I felt good and I was just so relaxed about everything and just happy. My anxiety was absent I couldn’t hear shit my inner critic had to say to fuck up the moment. And honestly I can control my drinking I will never become an addict I know how to cope without it even if it’s very difficult to actually relax and be present. But I don’t think it will be wrong to take a couple glasses every now and then. And I know us men barely have a shoulder to cry on sometimes and we have no other option to turn to the liquor and drink our problems away. ALCOHOL IS NOT THE SOLUTION GUYS!!! DRINK IN MODERATION. Alcohol can actually help you analyze your problems and get to the root of what causes you to feel certain ways. Pay attention to it and don’t get hooked.

1j6caua,1741420240.0,I feel like I’m on my own island.,"I am 38 y/o female, have always been single, have no close friends anymore who aren’t wrapped up in kids and their families, no siblings, my parents are around but are abusive and I feel like a constantly forgotten about human. 

I continually try to work on myself because I don’t blame other people - the common denominator is me - but even with all the work to try to be better and more receptive and open, I’m still just a passing thought it seems.  I think this makes it the hardest - that I’m just not good enough no matter what. 

I have social anxiety and online dating is horrible to me. I’ve tried the apps hundreds of times but I can’t bear it. 

Though no thoughts of harming myself in any way, I just have no desire for life.  No more hope of a family, tired of trying to make friends only for them to find someone and get married and forget about me, exhausted from professional networking that feels fake and superficial, drained from connectionless interactions. 

I recently was laid off from my job a few weeks ago and was shocked and hurt how few people reached out.   I was there for 4 years and was very involved. 

I’m kind and generous - constantly supporting others in so many ways, including financially when they need help.  

Typing this out I think — well this just sounds like you’re an unlikable, uninteresting, forgettable person.  I know it does, trust me! I just can’t figure out why to fix it. I try. 

I feel as if I’ve been a bit of a tortured soul my whole life. Like I’m being isolated from the world and just in it as an observer rather than a participant. 

Ive talked to a therapist but even with therapy, I don’t feel connected or truly heard. It feels like they’re always giving me suggestions of things I’ve tried a bajillion times with no luck like “joining a group that does something you like” or “just try one date online”. Been there done that more times than I can count. 

Anyone else feel this way?  I see people posting but then say “my husband” or “my sister” but I truly have nothing but my dog, who is my world.  Is this depth of loneliness common or am I also alone on this?

1j60jnh,1741382551.0,My parents have hurt me the most in my life.,"I am writing this because I am deeply hurt. 

My heart aches thinking about my situation.
I have never told this to anyone.

After years of having these feelings, I am writing this post to seek advice. 

I really need help. I feel like I am dying inside.

I am 26, male.
In childhood and teen days I have faced a lot of hate, abandonment from my parents.

Age: 9 to 15
I(assume I am Ram) was not a bright student, I used to get average grades in school. Due to this I faced a lot of shouting and somtimes beating from my parents.

My brother(lets call him Shyam) on the other hand used to score way above average scores. Due to this he got a lot of love. He got a lot of recognition in family both on nani and dadi side. 
People used to say Shyam kitna acha hai padhne me, Ram toh bekar nikammma ladka hai.
My brother was also usually very sick, maybe because of that he got more love and sympathy from my parents.

Whenever me and my brother had a dispute my parents always took my brother's side.

They used to shout at me and I used to get angry and irritated. 

Age: 15 to 21
My mother even told my brother not to talk to me. Even my mother stopped talking to me multiple times. How can a mother do this? 

These situation was not just once and twice, this used to happen frequently. 

Even my father used to shout at me on lots of things. When we have an argument then he also just stopped talking to me multiple times. 

Once my father stopped talking to me for 11 days. Can you imagine, you and your father are living in a same house, sitting in same rooms, seeing each other daily but your father is not talking to you?

And these situations used to repeat frequently. My respect for both my parents went down a lot. I even left my home once after argument with my parents.

These situations led me to do bad things like weed, cigarette, etc.

I kept smoking cigarette for years but now I have quit.

Around age 21-22:
In lockdown, due to bad economic condition at my home I decided that I will start studying and get a good job.

After some time of my graduation I got a really good job and starting earning very well.

After the job, I didn't face much shouting or arguments from my parents.

It just slowed down and my parents started respecting me. 

Around age 25:
Now I face very minimal argument or shouting from my parents side.

But we still have arguments. When we have arguments, my mind just goes back to the previous memories of my parents shouting at me, not talking to me for days, telling my brothers not to talk to me and so on.

Even small arguments or shouting triggers these feelings and brings back memories.

These are my parents who treated me like this, the two people who should always be on your side treated me like this? why did they shout at me? Why did they stopped talking to me? Why did they leave me lonely?
And now maybe I am earning, their attitude have changed towards me? Why?

Why did my parents did not sit down with me and talked to me when we had an argument? Why did my parents tried to solve things rather than not talking me to?

These memories are very hurting, I just keep thinking about these feelings. I feel so empty inside. I have started to not like my father, even though I love him. I automatically don't like talking to him.

Maybe I was at fault for not scoring good marks and arguing with my parents, that is why they treated me like this?

I don't know. 

I want to be proven wrong but I can't find a good enough reason.

This is really affecting my mental health. 
I want to remove these negative feelings.

1j656gf,1741395057.0,I genuinely believe that I am just not cut out for life,"
I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

1j620ke,1741386063.0,"I am so close, yet so far","I posted this rant on the ADHD sub about six months ago but I only just found this community so will post it verbatim here.

ADHD would explain why so much of my adult life has been so empty, lonely and miserable. I simply don't have the mental energy to put the effort into improving my life. Making friends, reaching out to people, being open and honest, enquiring and getting to know people, finding love, it's all been SO IMPOSSIBLY TIRING.

In December, I was referred to Nightingale Hospital in London to treat a possible deficiency of some kind. We hadn't said 'ADHD' yet so we were still treating depression symptoms. I was put on 20mg of Bupropion and it was like a third eye had been opened. I felt more present and active than I ever had in my entire life. My internal  protective filter was gone and I was the happiest and most present I'd ever felt. I went to a friends 30th and danced the most freely I'd ever done before.

Then my dosing got interrupted by forgetting to get the re-up when I'd run out. I'd gone a whole weekend without any. I got more from my local pharmacy but none of it, even under a double dose, ever did anything again.

After talking through the possibility of ADHD with my therapist, I went back to Nightingale and the questionnaire also pointed to the possibility of ADHD. After a couple of other meds including Modafinil and Concerta did nothing for me I'm now on 50mg of Elvanse after feeling groggy and headachy after a few days of 60..

And... it's working but it's not the same. I'm not overeating all the time like I usually do, I'm finding household and other mundane tasks easier to start ant follow through, but I don't have that clarity that I desperately want again, and it's fucking up my sleep which just has a knock on effect on the rest of my day. Maybe I need to try Bupropion again but the Doctor just said he 'didn't know' why it would stop working on me. I often feel like I'm somehow fairly resistant to medication working on me.

I don't know - I'm sitting here at night having not spoken to a single human being all day. I'm getting sick of the loneliness, old friends just don't respond to my invitations or messages any more and it doesn't help with the feeling of brokenness I've carried with me my whole life. My therapist would probably encourage me to be more direct and open with those people and try to start that dialogue in a more sincere manner (and being more open and vulnerable sounds like the most impossible thing to me - when has it ever been taught to me that that's okay, and acceptable, and wanted from me in society, or with people?) and frankly I feel a bit betrayed by the callousness of it all.

I once asked some Reddit forums for advice on how to deal with the pain of having so little fanfare or celebration on my last birthday and I was basically called pathetic for daring to care about it treated like a pathetic loser for caring at my age. Am I meant to just pack it in? To eat shit? To stop dreaming of a fulfilling life of friendship? The kind I've never had?

Sorry - to get back on track.... I feel like I'm so close, to finding the medication that will make it click and bring back that clarity, that feeling like I don't need to filter myself any more. But deep inside I'm scared that..... there isn't an answer.

1j5v04n,1741369818.0,I have over 5 different diagnosis from my childhood and I genuinely think that's too many.,"I (24M) have received a number of diagnosis throughout my life, despite having a pretty normal life, job and even enrolling in uni later this fall. 

Over my, let's call it rough, childhood and going though foster care I was diagnosed by several doctors with differing conditions including Autism, ADD/HD, Asperger's, and Anxiety; even as an adult I have received a diagnosis of CPDSD, bipolar mania/depression and my current psychiatrist says I show signs of possible dissociative identity disorder but haven't received an official diagnosis.

I seem to have bits and pieces of each diagnosis but some symptoms and signs clash with each other and ones like Asperger's have been ruled out since that diagnosis was no longer medically accepted. 

I take medications for Bipolar, autism and mood swings and I see my psychiatrist and psychologist regularly every month or when there's a mental emergency 

No other person I know of has over this many mental health issues and I'm seeing my psychiatrist next week to talk to him about possibly getting officially tested for all of this and paying for clinical studies.

1j5u2b7,1741367892.0,"Help please? Master's degree in Teaching, Literature or Linguistics?","Maybe this is not the right place to post something like this, I'm sorry if that's the case.

I'm hopefully finishing my degree soon. Right now, I'm just scared. I have the opportunity to apply for only one Master's degree, which would be either in Teaching, Linguistics or Literature in my maternal language. 

I'm struggling a lot to make a decision because one of the serious problems that I have is the fact that I live in an awful European country. Here (I guess like everywhere else, too), I can't find a decent job with a Linguistics or Literature Master's. In the city where I live, finding a decent job as an editor/librarian would be immensely difficult as there are simply no opportunities. 

Because of this, getting a Master's in teaching is undoubtedly the best option in my country (in terms of employment and being able to be financially independent). However, my other problem is the fact I suffer from social anxiety. Sometimes it's hard for me to socialize and I keep thinking I won't be able to make it through the interview or even the written exam.

What is the best option here for someone like me? Realistically I'm more likely to get accepted into Linguistics or Literature degree, but I'd be wasting my money and time for nothing. If I choose a Master's in Teaching, it's like I'd have to find a way to fix myself.

I have until the end of this month to decide. Can anyone please give me some advice?

1j5r9jd,1741362054.0,Someone choked me when I was younger and now I think I have PTSD,"There isn't much context besides what happened. Around the time of middle school, a friend thought it was funny to wrap her hands around my neck and sometimes would also kind of squeeze, but not enough to hurt me or cut off my air. I told her to stop and she didn't until high school. While I was in high school I had a boyfriend who touched my neck and I'd always jerk away. Even if there was a wall behind me, I wouldn't care. I'd hit my head on the wall if I had to say he'd stop touching my neck. Also, the girl randomly jumped on me or touched me and now I freak out at random touches. I'm asking if anyone might know if this is something like PSTD, anxiety, or if I'm just overreacting since the girl never did cut off my air.

She did this multiple times for the 2 years I was in middle school. In high school, she acted nicer, and I knew she was better due to her asking to touch me and such. I still tried to stay away from her and attempted to move classes to avoid her or have my other friends talk to her. I got flashbacks throughout high school and still get them now. Some days, I avoid everything due to flashbacks in the morning or during the day. Other times, I don't get flashbacks unless the girl directly talks to me or touches me. I think my ex-boyfriend also made it worse since he did a similar thing yet never choked me.

1j5fsv0,1741323619.0,What should I do,"I made this account for this post because It will allow me to feel comfortable enough to be honest for once.

I’m 21 and I have absolutely no desire to continue living. I remember first feeling this way when I was around 11-12 years old and it’s never gone away, so for me, I’ve lived most of my live depressed. Over those years I’ve taken numerous attempts on my life (taking 2 pill bottles, self harm, and intentionally crashing into a tree to name a few) and my biggest regret each time is that I wasn’t successful. I now eat one meal every couple days because if I eat more than that I throw up (typically fast food). I used to get 8 hours of sleep but I now waste my time sitting in my room all day fantasizing my own death. The last 2 years I’ve only go outside when I get in my car to go to and leave work. And even though I live with my parents, I only  talked to them every couple days, and that’s only because I run into them on my way to my room. I’ve been trying to wait for their deaths so they would Atleast think I’m going to be ok but that seems like it would take too long. I also don’t enjoy talking to people or being around them, so I slowly lost all my “friends” after school.

I know it seems like it can be fixed by eating more, getting 8 hours of sleep, reconnecting with my family and getting therapy. However I tried all these things over the course of 11-12 years (6 therapists and 2 in-patient places) and it only confirmed for me that I shouldn’t be here. I just can’t bring myself to care for anyone around me or even myself (introspection tells me it could be from an absent father). I’ve been chain-smoking and stopped working out to try to deteriorate my health but I by no means want a slow death.

What makes this situation perplexing to me is that my life isn’t particularly bad. I have a good paying job, I save and invest 80-90% of my income, and I’m respected by my peers for my work ethic. I know my parents aren’t the best, but they do what they believe is right and I know that I’m the problem in the equation. 

I feel like I have to pretend to be someone I’m not in order to get through the day. Im unable to trick myself into thinking my life is important or has any meaning even though the people around me can do it easily. I can elaborate on anything if anyone needs more details because I left a lot out that could be important and I want to hear your perspective on why you believe I’m wrong or possibly another way of thinking about it? Because even when everything is going perfect in my life, all I can think about is how I don’t want to be here. 

Any advice is appreciated, but keep in mind I tried therapy, working out, socializing, new job, getting closer with family but it didn’t really help me at all.

1j5ksi5,1741344519.0,Can I hear some arguments for not killing myself?,"

I (21M) have not really been happy ever. I grew up getting belittled by everyone around me, abused by an older sibling, treated like I'm stupid by both my parents and my other siblings, and I don't really have anything going on.

I live with my dad and sister right now, and I don't think they'd be hurt too much. I think they'd get over it an move on well.

I wanted a doctorate, and to be successful in college or in writing, but I don't have any motivation to really do anything ever. I work a job I hate, and I don't think my coworkers would be too bothered either.

I'm not dating anyone, in fact I recently got broken up with (The girl realized she's gay, which I don't blame her for. She can't help that. I hope she gets a woman who cares about her the same way I did.)

I've got a friend group I play DND and video games with every so often, but I don't think they'd really be too bothered either.

My sister is better than me in every way. She's accomplished, and intelligent, has a partner, and is doing so well in highschool. She's making none of the mistakes I did, like she pursues extracurriculars, and socializes, and she's gonna go far. I don't think I will or can.

Meanwhile, I'm struggling hard in college. I'm doing the prerequisites for a bachelors in science, but I've hit a brick wall where the last few classes I need feel impossible, and I get paralyzed and feel completely lost when it comes to the work. I'll likely be dropped from or fail most of my classes this semester, and I don't even do full time at college or work.

I do have depression and an attention disorder. I've received medication and counseling for both, and it did not work. I think I'm resistant to the medication or something because it doesn't do anything.

I kinda want to just disappear, or pick a direction and walk in it without telling anyone.

The only emotions that I can really recall for the last several years are anger, sadness, hopelessness, or numbness.

I don't know why I shouldn't just kill myself if it's always like this. Anyone who I'm close to would get over it, my cat and dog would go to my sister. Anyone who would be sad would only be sad for a little bit, and then they'd move on with their lives and be fine, while I'd finally get to be free of this.

I've got a note drafted, and I'll print it off or write a new one because its pretty venomous, and I don't know if I'd want my last words to family and friends to be so harsh, but I don't know.

1j5h71x,1741328878.0,"Addicted to porn/hyper sexual and waiting for help with ibogaine, M21","Found this sub and thought I might as well post. 

I have been trying for over 6 years to quit. I am 21 year old male and have been trying since I was 14.5 years old. It gives me a lot of anxiety, depression, gives me headaches, fatigue, intrusive sexual thoughts, and changes my view in women to be more objectifying even though I dislike it. If you look at my post history you can tell Im a bit fucking nuts, it really affects me in a terrible way. I have been to multiple therapist by the way and am starting to think it is not trauma related as much as it is just a dopaminergic issue.

I will jerk off in my sleep (sexsomnia) if I havent had a release in awhile, get anxiety attacks, and those sexsomnia and sex dreams always cause me to relapse. 

I have tried shrooms, semaglutide, tirzepetadie, naltrexone, NAc, and other things in hopes of helping. The only thing that helps is microdosing psychedelics.

I am now waiting for an ibogaine trip as it is known as an addiction interrupter and helps people in dire scenarios. I am hoping it can help me but it is about 3.75 months away from happening so I have to wait. Then if it doesnt work I dont fucking know man. If I have a sex dream and I dont relapse I just end up having another one and my body just gives out on itself. I dont want to be doped up all the time and have erectile dysfunction and watch that horrid shit when I want to have a loving family instead. These intrusive sexual thoughts that are visual just come up so much that I feel my brain relapses on its own even if I am doing something else.

Any support or advice is helpful, please dont tell me to moderate my porn/jerking off usage or say it isnt addictive. I know Ive done some shit the normal person wouldnt but I just hate this shit so much and I know it holds me back so much.

1j5ddup,1741315535.0,Looking for clarity and wondering if others have the same experience?,"I've been diagnosed with a few mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety, depression, CPTSD, and bipolar disorder, although I'm uncertain about the latter diagnosis and wonder if it might be more accurate to consider ADHD or autism instead. Since childhood, I've experienced recurring, distressing 'episodes' that are often triggered by hurtful comments (It's really hurtful when things are taken out on me, especially when I haven't done anything wrong or even involved in the situation) and characterized by intense emotional turmoil, repetitive thoughts, and a strong desire to isolate myself from others. These episodes can last a few hours, and sometimes they can escalate into a bout of depression that lingers for weeks or even months. Despite having worked with a therapist for five years, I recently lost access to their services due to insurance issues, which has left me feeling uncertain and unsupported. During these episodes, I feel completely overwhelmed by my emotions, and my thoughts become fixated on phrases like 'I want to go home' or 'I'm sorry,' which play on repeat in my mind. I feel tiny, insignificant, and powerless, as if everything is pointless and nothing truly matters. Life just feels like it's too much. Yet during these episodes i can not communicate what im feeling or what i need i cant get anything else out other than ' i want to go home' or 'im sorry' Im exhausted after an episode and Eventually, I become numb and detached, feeling like a robot without any sense of purpose or passion. I also experience intense physical sensations, such as feeling like I've been stabbed in the chest or being crushed by an invisible force. I'm currently in the midst of one of these episodes, and I'm desperately seeking clarity on what might be causing them and how I can learn to manage them more effectively.

1j5cjfs,1741312893.0,"I often struggle with overthinking, catastrophizing, and reading into small things too much. I need advice on navigating these difficult thoughts so that it doesn't destroy my relationship.","I am a non-binary individual in their mid-20s, and I've been with my boyfriend for over a year now. I've always struggled with overthinking and reading into situations a bit, But it's been especially bad with this relationship. It's the first serious and intimate relationship I've ever been in, and I'd like for it to be the only one. I adore my boyfriend and he's the love of my life, despite his flaws. He's wonderful and has been so patient with me even when I've been difficult and hurtful at times in my mental illness spells. It sucks. I need to get my s*** together. I'm constantly paranoid that he's going to cheat on me or just be unfaithful - and I know a lot of these thoughts stem from me not feeling like I'm good enough or pretty enough. Though I'm non-binary, I live a woman's experience offline as I present very femininely and was assigned female at birth. (The reason I dress femininely is to help offset my dysphoria because I can't achieve the look I truly want when I try to bind, so at least dressing up pretty makes me feel more confident about myself even if it's not ideal.) Both me and my boyfriend are pan, although I think he does have a bit of a preference for girls/fems? Which I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with leaning more towards one gender with bi/pan sexualities - it's just something I've noticed with the way he talks about things and stuff, Plus I can understand being less open about same-sex attraction for men specifically considering how other guys can Be about it.

I feel ridiculous for doing this but I looked at his Instagram follows and I noticed he does follow a lot of pretty girls, some who have posted kind of scandalous images of themselves. I expressed discomfort with the idea of him receiving any type of sexual gratification from other people, even if it's just pictures/p*rn - and he says that he's been trying to stop ever since it first came up in conversation. You see, we both have struggled with hypersexuality due to trauma in our childhood (me, I've been avoidant my whole life and that makes him my first) so we're both breaking out of that addictive headspace. I guess I'm just struggling with feeling like I can trust him to keep that promise? I know it's informed by my own self-esteem issues. I just want us both to be able to be passionate and healthy about our intimate life. I don't think there's anything wrong with watching p*rn inherently, But I do think too much of it can be a bad thing cuz it does have a psychological effect on the brain. I stopped my addiction because I wanted to retrain my brain and focus all of my attention on him. And I don't know, I feel like looking at other people's scandalous posts and actively engaging with that type of content despite your partner expressing discomfort with that is disrespectful to the relationship? I believe he understands that. Again, I'm just struggling with my own internal trust.

What can I do to stop overthinking? What can I do to stop reading into every little thing and wondering if small things are red flags? I feel like TikTok has completely rotted my brain because I'm constantly getting people talking about their experiences with their partners having affairs / Reddit stories about cheating and I'm so tired. I just want to feel comfortable in my relationship. I don't think he's capable of it, though I didn't know him at the time he was totally reckless and a ""bad kid"" back in high school and because of those bad experiences he's grown up quite a lot and has a lot more experience with those type of situations, and if he didn't want to be with me we wouldn't be together planning our future 6 months in advance. He's a lovely person and I just.. can't imagine the person he is now doing that to me? But it doesn't stop the insecurities anyway. Does anyone have any grounding techniques? Or perspectives that I could consider to help me deal with this? I'm planning on going to therapy at some point this year to better help me deal with the deeper issues but, any advice/support would help. Especially because I'm pretty inexperienced with social media and relationships in general, I was always the social introvert who avoided people and just wanted to be nerdy about my interest at home so I feel like a fish out of water with this specific dynamic.

Even if the worst case scenario did happen, What can I do? I don't really have family I can ask for support for this. My friends all live busy lives and aren't familiar with the type of relationship I'm in cuz theyre like me before I got into a relationship.

1j5b401,1741308564.0,Losing my sanity. Desperate for help.,"20m. About three weeks ago I took 50,000IU of rD2, I’m deficient in Vitamin D and I’ve taken this dose dozens of times before, the last one being three months ago since I’d ran out. Immediately after taking it I started getting extreme symptoms, muscle twitches all over, involuntary movements, insomnia, zero appetite, debilitating fatigue, and the worst of all, extreme brain fog. It got so bad that I went to the ER after a few days of feeling like this, they did blood work and it came back normal, calcium was normal and so was Vitamin D, so I didn’t get any Vitamin D toxicity. My condition only worsened, the brain fog started to get so bad that I was losing my sense of reality. I once again went to the ER and got a CT scan done which came back clean. My doctor also ordered an mri scan a few days later, which also came back clean. I then learned that vitamin d can maybe deplete magnesium, I then started supplementing with magnesium which ended up making me feel worse. The brain fog turned into dissociation/derealization,  I feel like I’ve lost my sense of reality, I feel like I’m not awake, I’m sensitive to noise and light. When I’m looking at something with my eyes, it feels like I’m not actually looking at it. It’s driving me completely insane. I quit my job and dropped out of all my classes. A few days ago my entire right side of the body has become weak. I feel like I’m going insane, for the past three weeks it has been a constant hell.

I got spoiled, met a bunch of her partners, she then got diagnosed with cancer and did after couple years, I was 8 at the time. About that time, my mental health issues started. Then I moved with my father and my new step mom. That started 10 year period of depression, coping mechanisms all caused by her very loving parenting and her great and open relationship with her. I run from home twice and there isn't a single person I would hate more. Also, my father really never was there for me whet it was most needed and I basically grew unable to car for myself, have coping mechanism that does not allow me to care about anything and anybody, including myself.

And that brings me to today. I moved out 4 months earlier with money I inherited. And since then, things got worse. I can't really support myself, I live of an inheritance, I fell deeper into depression and I am happy and smile only because I decided to. I don't feel anything most of the time.

Please, are there any books or ways that would help get on track, start caring about myself and actually build meaningful relationships. Not just being the laughing stock of my ""friends"".

1j57gzj,1741298606.0,I don’t know what to do,"I feel as though I’ve gotten myself into quite a situation within the past 5 years of my life. 5 years ago I decided to leave my abusive family and over the years have come to heal from it. However, I feel there have been some lasting and significant effects of that decision. I feel incredibly insecure in my facets of my life. This can be due to me getting bullied pretty regularly since I was in like junior high. But mixed with the fact that I no longer have the unconditional aspects that come along with a family, I feel even more insecure to put myself out there and to even trust people. Even with the people closest to me I feel like I’m a burden and annoying. I have a hard time deciphering whether what someone is saying is genuine or if it’s BS.  With all that being said, it’s left me in a state where, while im in a relationship, I have almost no friends and have no motivation to build up the courage to make new ones.

1j56e5r,1741295862.0,I'm having really dark thoughts/fantasies and i dont know what to do,"I normally wouldn't come on to a public forum like these to seek help, but due to uncontrollable circumstances im currently unable to attend therapy and these morbid thoughts have become concerningly prevalent in my life. Im truly at a loss as to what I should do and will really take any advice or support I can get right now. 

I figure to paint the fullest picture, I should give some context on me. I am diagnosed with depression, ADHD, substance use disorder, and anxiety, with a history of suicidal ideations. Some doctors have said I show signs of bipolar disorder or BPD as well. Growing up I experienced childhood sexual molestation as well as verbal, mental, and physical abuse. The verbal and mental end of this would carry out long into my teen years. I am 18F currently and because of years of drug addiction, I'm not trusted to live on my own, leaving me stuck in the house I grew up in. My life for the past year had been pretty dull, my depression would come and go in waves but for the most part I held a very close knit and quiet life. That was, up until a few months ago.

As I've been trying to remain abstinent from narcotics, I've been pushed to an isolation of sorts. I do school online and am not permitted out of the house. I don't have a door on my bedroom and I'm not trusted to administer my own medications. I have little to no access to the internet, accept for when I'm doing my school courses. Out of desperation I often go onto reddit forums or blogs instead to get a taste of social interaction. I have made plans to move out and quickly backed out of them out of fear of my guardians reaction. If it was my guess, I'd say this would be whats contributing to these recent thoughts. 

In regards to these thoughts, they range from risky to downright deadly. It started with an increase in sexual drive. I was pleasuring myself a lot and watching a lot of porn. This wasn't exactly new, I'd always been aware I had a slightly higher libido than most other girls i knew, i attributed this to a traumatic long term effect of my assault. This wasn't a problem until I began having progressively darker and darker sexual fantasies. Kidnapping, severe bodily harm, abuse, rape, and torture. These are things that put me in grave danger, yet i pursued them online. I participated in deeply risky and degrading sexual behavior and I found it hard to exude any impulse control over this. I'd post exposing photos with my ace in them on public forums, then hours later delete them when my head cleared. Then came the more morbid thoughts. I had deep intrigue on hurting and killing others. I know this is wrong and it would bring me tons of mental anguish because these werent things that ever aligned with my beliefs, but still i found it hard to stop myself from looking into these things on dangerous sites and researching ways to get away with it. These thoughts make me want to kill myself in response, but i still couldnt shake this need to keep searching and scouring for darker and darker things.  It got to the point where i was daily researching brutal crimes and watching videos on porn sites that exclusively published ideas of women being raped and tortured. 

I really do hate myself for thinking these things and doing these things, but I dont know how to make it stop. I know if i speak about it I'll be baker acted and I fear that might make things worse. I've made a pact with myself that if it came down to it, I would kill myself before I even thought about going through with something that could harm someone else. This is embarassing to even speak about and im so deeply ashamed. I don't want to publish this but im truly at a stand still and don't know what steps to take. i just need help, support, or advice. above all else im terrified.

1j54yfd,1741292262.0,Brother asked me to help him deal with his psychotic wife,"Hello,

There's a TL;DR at the bottom. 

My brother lives with his wife and her 15 year old son. About 2 or 3 months ago she began to experience paranoid delusions with auditory hallucinations. She thought there were cameras watching her in a particular room she spent time in. It began centralized in that single room but eventually branched out to the entire house. 

Over time, she had developed these conspiracy theories that CPS was stalking her and would take her son away. She believes there is a federal case against her. She has called the police, the FBI, and lawyers. The police gave my brother information on government mental health programs but she refuses to go because she believes they're out to get her. She will say that she's willing to get a psych evaluation but always has an excuse not to go when he brings it up. 

This weekend the situation has become more serious. My brother drove her to another city so she could take care of her father, who was recently diagnosed with late stage cancer. He found her climbing into the attic with his samurai sword trying to find some device she believed was monitoring her. He tried to take it from her and things got violent. The cops were called and her poor father was arrested. My brother picked her up and took her back home. 

She's now there being a total wreck. She won't do anything to help herself. She won't contribute. He has to do everything by himself and he's becoming far too strained. He's asked for me help in dealing with her. 

You should know that we all suspect her of abusing drugs. She has a history of drug abuse and does not have very much self control. The drugs I know she used in the past include meth and air dusters. Whippets. THC. I don't know about any others. Meth would certainly explain these symptoms. But my brother has seen no evidence. No smells. She may be eating the meth. But he doesn't know how she could be getting it. At this point it might be possible the extended drug abuse has caused permanent psychosis. I've seen that in other people. But I'm not a mental health professional. I'm a former addict and alcoholic. So I know quite a bit about drug abuse. And I've been around a lot of people with various afflictions. 

What advice can I relay to my brother in how to deal with her? How can he convince her to get a psych evaluation? He doesn't want to kick her out. 

TL;DR: My brother's wife has psychosis, paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations, conspiracy theories, and is a danger to herself, her son, and my brother. What can I do to help them? What advice can I relay to him? 

Thank you.

1j54oqk,1741291575.0,How do you help someone in overwhelmingly deep depression?,"My sister in law lost her dad a couple years ago, and there's nothing that has helped her over the years to help cope with the situation. She refuses to accept it, and basically pretends her dad is ""on vacation"" I can't even say ""Dad"" around her (when referring to my own father) without her suddenly becoming emotional. This whole ordeal is taking a toll on my sister as well since they are both married and live together.

She becomes the most emotional and angry when she drinks, and then basically verbally attacks our whole family because she felt we were not there for her when her father passed.

Just recently, she spoke out again about not wanting to be here (living), and she wants to be with her father, and she feels her life is worth nothing, and that she has no one in her life. Her mom is a drug addict, so they don't talk that much, but she is also constantly telling us she is ""not crazy"" and it's ""not the alcohol"" whenever she goes off about this whole situation when she's drinking. So yes, there's some denial going on within her as well.

Neither me nor my sister know what to do about this because you can't force someone to seek professional help if they are not willing, and so my sister has learned to just put up with her emotions regardless of how my sister-in-law acts, but this is not fair for her. How am I able to turn this situation around ?!",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j54oqk/how_do_you_help_someone_in_overwhelmingly_deep/,sister law lost dad couple years ago theres nothing helped years help cope situation refuses accept basically pretends dad vacation cant even say dad around referring father without suddenly becoming emotional whole ordeal taking toll sister well since married live together becomes emotional angry drinks basically verbally attacks whole family felt father passed recently spoke wanting living wants father feels life worth nothing one life mom drug addict dont talk much also constantly telling us crazy alcohol whenever goes whole situation shes drinking yes theres denial going within well neither sister know cant force someone seek professional help willing sister learned put emotions regardless sisterinlaw acts fair able turn situation around
1j54ffv,1741290940.0,My memory is getting worse. 15F,"Since last year, my memory has been getting worse. At first, it was a bit mundane, like forgetting assignments and classwork, but I think it's spiraling out of control. I'm forgetting where I put my money, to put on basic necessities like deodorant and brushing my teeth, I'm forgetting what I said to my guardians. 

  
Today was the final straw. I am currently on my period, and just now I went to use the bathroom. Imagine my surprise when I realized I didn't have my pad on. I could've sworn I put on this morning, I even remember unwrapping it, but I didn't put it on, and I don't know why. 

  
I am currently planning a story that takes up a lot of my thinking time, and I often devote most of my hours to it. I don't know if that is a contributing factor, because I have been experiencing memory problems before this, but it has amplified since I have started the project.

  
My worsening memory is getting scarier, and I'd like to gain some insight into what's going on. I suffer from chronic depression if that helps, but personally I don't see that as a factor.

1j537gf,1741287849.0,I need advice?,"Soo...the last few months have been hell. It started with a series of traumatic events/big changes throughout the year that piled up and eventually overwhelmed me after one particularly traumatizing event. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety spiraled out of control, and it all went downhill from there. I believe this was.. December when I finally broke. I'm not sure, as I can't remember almost anything from then. I saw my psychiatrist back in...january? Of this year (Remember this) and not even 2 sentences in she said I was bipolar. (And this) All I could do was sit there in shock and simply utter 'no i'm not', and after that I kinda checked out. I do remember her mentioning it's because I have 'episodes'.....yes, I do have 'episodes' but of anxiety. Something will happen, completely overwhelm me and fuck me up for six months then I have to build myself up back from ground zero. It's always been something different, with the running theme of anxiety and some form of dissociation. First it was weird headaches (whaddya know, anxiety!!) then it was dissociation x 20, and now it's...this? When those pass, i'm completely fine, except for certain moments of anxiety. I am always in a mild state of dissociation and always on guard, but i'm..comfortable..?..with it when i'm not all messed up. So this particular episode, the one i'm experiencing right now, consists of phases. First, nonstop rampant anxiety, I couldn't sleep, eat, function. I was going a million miles a second. The thought of anything relaxing, things I enjoyed made me anxious. And then that calmed down, I thought I was on the road of feeling better...WRONG!!! I got sick ontop of lady problems. I think I was depressed? Low energy, dull, hopeless, I can't find enjoyment in anything, but overwhelmingly anxious. I got better, Then the dissociation kicked in and ohhh boy we went for a spin. My sleep schedule has been horrible this entire time. I'm too scared to sleep most nights. I'm either up all night, crash around 9am and wake up around 12pm (day) or I fall asleep anytime after 12am and wake up anywhere between 9am-11am. I have not been sleeping good. Last Saturday was one of those up all night bits, I didn't fall asleep til 9am sunday woke up around 1pm? 2pm? And then immediate dissociation. Night doesn't feel like it's night. The concept of time barely exists. I feel like I have been run over and backed up on by a train for extra measure. It's like a really weird, extreme depersonalization. And then maybe brain fog ontop of it? My thoughts feel dull, muted, like I can't think, and that has me in a tizzy because i've never felt that before. It feels like my body and mind are separated. But then me and my mind are also seperated? I feel like I can't engage in anything or distract myself. And when the anxiety bubbles over it's extremely overwhelming..like nothing I have felt before. It feels like everything i'm experiencing will never go away. But it's also like... completely in the background. Like i'm not feeling it to its full extent. Hence where the dissociation comes into play? Idk... it's the most intense, non intense feeling ever. I can't see my psychiatrist until the 25th. I feel like i'll go crazy before then. Every day is hell, and I don't know what's wrong with me. Anyhow, remember when I mentioned my psychiatrist? Yes..she prescribed me abilify. Funny story, i'm terrified to take medication, and having to take medication was the trigger of my last dissociation/anxiety combo finishing move. Couldn't leave the house for months. I was also on abilify during that time, near when I started feeling better. She said I told her I felt better on it...but I just can't remember telling her that? That was months ago. When I felt better I quit my meds..then the year goes by and boom..here we are. But with this new dose, I haven't taken it yet. She prescribed it in January. It's been sitting on my dresser because i'm too scared to take it. I'm worried it's not the right medication for how I'm feeling? Or it won't help me? Or it'll make me feel worse? I don't know... What should I do? Should I give it a try???? If anyone has any advice or ideas or anything..please. please let me know.

1j4pfk6,1741243048.0,Struggling with my Emotions and Feeling even okay,"I often struggle to talk about how I feel because it feels so heavy. I want to work on putting myself first, but sometimes I feel like I can't be present in my life, which makes it hard to move past certain things. I try to breathe and process my emotions, but I feel stuck and overwhelmed. It's tough to stay calm, and I’m unsure if what I feel is normal. I want to focus on my goals instead of just reacting to my moods, yet I’m scared to let myself feel good about them. 

Sometimes I feel a lot of tension in my body—like in my shoulders and jaw—and I often ignore that pain. I worry I'm not being fully present for my son and that makes me feel guilty, even though I try my best. I wish I knew how to show up for him while navigating my own feelings.

Crying feels like a relief for me right now, but it also reminds me of how long it’s been since I really expressed myself. I want to find a way to share my feelings with a therapist or someone I trust because I want reassurance that I'm okay and that what I feel is just part of life. I fear being seen as crazy for feeling this way, and the idea of needing a mental hospital terrifies me. 

I've been thinking about how to describe my feelings—like how I can go from being really sad to feeling okay so quickly, and I don’t know if that’s normal. I sometimes worry that I'm just rambling without making sense, but talking it out helps me. I want to take time for myself without worrying about what others think. I know I’m just a human feeling things deeply, which is okay. Even though my head hurts because of all the thoughts, crying also makes me feel good in a strange way. 

I’m becoming more aware of my body and how tense it is all the time, which I’ve normalized. It feels like no matter how much I try to relax, I can still feel that stiffness inside me. It helps to acknowledge that I'm going through a lot and gives me hope in processing these feelings. It's okay to feel everything, and I'm learning to accept what I'm experiencing.

1j4qvsk,1741249360.0,I need help understanding what I’m going through,"hey guys I know no one can say anything professionally and for certain but any input from ur knowledge helps. I am trying to book an app with my psychiatrist ASAP but for now for the past week or two I have been writing down things in my notes app for how I’ve been feeling and it’s just getting more intense and intense and I’m not sure what’s going on. Is it mania? OCD symptoms I don’t know. For background I am diagnosed with bipolar 2, anxiety, ocd, clinical depression and struggled with anorexia. Here’s what I have written I know it may be hard to follow and read because it was just quickly jotting notes but anything helps. :

Why do I keep lying. Doing impulsive things and like saying the most whack things ever. 

Lately I have been searching up everything about like myself I need to know everything about everything I become like fixated on something then need to know everything and I can’t stop researching like I want to stop I don’t even fuckint want to be doing it like I can’t stop I just have to do it and when I do I feel like relaxed for a bit but then I just comes back and in turn r from all this research I have also discovered that this is obsessive compulsive tendancies  so maybe my ocd is getting bad again or smth or maybe I am just a fucking lunatic I don’t know bruh  

A part of my brain has like convinced itself that every mental illness I have had I have like made up 
A) anorexia I did it all to like get diagnosed and have something to cry about but like no i fuxking didn’t like I almost died 
B) bipolar I am making it up but like no I’m not like I’m not but I am
C) ocd I made it up I can stop if I want to but NO I CANT
D) I’ve convinced myself I am a sociopath or something insane like that because I feel as though I am insane but like no I am not I’m literally not but yes i am I don’t even know what to do 

I AM GOING CRAZY I AM GOING CRAZY 

Maybe I am just starting to become manic but no I am not I am fine but NO I AM NOT 

My mind is buzzing it cannot stop buzzing I cannot stop thinking I feel like I am exploding 

I am not sleeping. 
This is mania

1j4qd5d,1741247053.0,I think I'm relapsing and my family is a huge part of it,"I (27 F) have struggled with my mental health at an early age and was last diagnosed with bipolar 2. A year ago I lost my job, my precious dog and I'm borderline giving up on my career on engineering. 

Right after I lost my job I isolated myself from the world and I barely get out of the house. The only times I do go outside is when I'm with my best friend or if I really need to go out, and it was barely 10 times in the past year. I live with my parents since I can barely afford to live at this point (and not for the lack of trying) but my family can't seem to understand that the reason I can't get a physical job is I can't go out. 

My brain is so messed up that even the thought of stepping out of the house sends into a full blown panic attack. I know that I'm spiralling back into depression but my family (even my once depressed brother) is telling me that I'm useless and that they all thought that once I graduated from university I'll be the one who gives them money. Now they're treating me like I'm a burden and the snide remarks are getting to me.

1j4qcq1,1741246999.0,Peace of mind,"Ive posted and deleted dozens of threads to do with committing however, it was always an ask for help and not for genuine advice. Each time 1-2 people help me get through the night but this time its very different to me, i feel peace.

I dont think i want to end it, im not totally sure, but not a thought in the last year has brought me more peace and happiness than doing so. Im not even scared to think it anymore. I just feel like why not?

703,000 people commit every year, and a fraction of the amount tell their story on why they were wrong. Ive talked to anyone i could for help but i feel i just dont work that way, therapy, councillors, etc.

I’ve done things i cant even admit on reddit, hurt many people, and have never felt an ounce of empathy for these things I’ve done. Ive never thought of myself as a psychopath but its difficult processing any feelings. Hell, I know many people would pray i make the decision but ive never really cared of those opinions.

I have the thought that, who the hell knows whats good for me? like truly? my peace of mind is like jenny from forest gump, “Please turn me into a bird so i can fly far far away”

Who is to tell me im wrong that if i make the decision i wont go soaring in the sunset of bliss, fly high in the clouds with my family, bask in the moonlight of the heavens. Nobody can convince me anymore that talking to people and therapy is better than taking the chance on what i believe in.

Im not saying I’m going to kill myself tonight however, for the first time I’m not scared of it and i feel like i can get away from the darkness and brutality I’ve brought on myself and others.

I appreciate anyone who responds or messages me however, unlike the past, I’m not looking for that anymore. I think I’m trying to find that soaring bliss in my day to day before i seek in the heavens. 

I apologize to anyone who is going through hard times and i urge you not to take my words as advice because my beliefs guide my mind, it is not true to every being. I don’t actually know what im going for here, I guess just admitting to myself no matter which side i choose i should seek peace.

I feel i have no remorse or feelings however, i seem to care enough to seek the validation of strangers so there must be something. Again, i’m more so venting than seeking advice i just dont know where to post this.

1j4p5mn,1741241905.0,Fluvoxamine and OCD,"Fluvoxamine SSRi

Hi yall…gonna make it short ive had chronic OCD my whole life. Repetitive racing intrusive thoughts 24/7 and compulsions. 

Benzos just made it worse so i stopped. They only helped the panic that ocd itself brings because its so stressful and awful but its temporary relief and not worth what benzos come with so I told my Dr i was leaving them.

I also have a chronic GI disease and it is linked to lack of serotonin. So i decided to finally give an SSRi a try. 

I started Fluvoxamine 25mg once a day, almost a month ago. 

On week two of that, i went up to 50mg. 

Ive been there since. 
I felt better the first few days on 50mg (thoughts were still there but not as brutal which is a relief and a blessing in itself) and all of a sudden i feel incredibly down and stagnant and the thoughts are almost worsening. 

Not sure if i should stay on 50mg for a few more weeks, in the hope that itll be enough of a a dose and i just simply have to give it time?

Or is it not enough of a dose for OCD and i should just go up to 75mg for a few days, and then to 100mg?
(Id like to not go over 100mg for as long as i can for now) 

Please help. Ive heard and read and been told that im on way too low of a dose for OCD, especially OCD as severe as mine. Would really appreciate feedback from others that have actually gone through it.

I've been overwhelmed with anxiety for...a long time. And recent events in the government have just sent my anxiety through the roof.

Really nice lady. She told me that I'm smart and funny (but I'm paying her, so I take that with a grain of salt 🤣). I told her that my go to for dealing with stress is to check out and go to a happy place in my head. I was surprised that she said that it was a good method to deal with stress (as long as I can still function normally). I think most importantly for me, she told me that when you stress about the past (whoulda, coulda, shoulda) that you're dealing more with depression. When you stress about the future and things that you can't control, it's most likely anxiety. I never made that connection and it makes so much sense!

She recommended cognitive behavioral therapy for me and mindfulness, and feels like I'm well grounded. I need to stop doom scrolling and be more present, but my daydreaming isn't as big of an issue as I thought it was.

1j4o2lb,1741237824.0,I don't know what's going on with me and it's so frustrating,"
My mood has been never constant in these few months, and mostly it's always full of guilt and shame about myself. 
I might have to give a background first so here it is-- 
I'm currently 18, a student, I was always a sincere and a disciplined student and got good grades throughout, but it's been changing now. 
I've always been an anxious person, but the anxiety I feel now is too much for me, theres panic attacks more frequently and quite a lot of crying comes with it. 
So I passed out my highschool and I decided to give an year for preparation of an entrance exam, it was going very smoothly during the start, but it started to crumble down later on. I chose to prepare online, that made me cut off all my connections with most of my friends, basically made me a bit isolated, I had my family of course. 
Everything had gotten overwhelming for me slowly, but I tried to push through. But now I don't feel like working at all, I'm trying to avoid it like anything, I feel like I'm being lazy and it's so pathetic but I'm not that kind of a person who is lazy at all. I've watched countless videos on how to be more productive, disciplined, etc thinking that I'm not disciplined enough, but something tells me that's not it.  I sleep too much sometimes and get random headaches. I know I have the potential to do it but I just can't and it's so frustrating. Whats more frustrating is that I don't understand what's wrong. Even as I write this I feel like I'm exaggerating and trying to pretend like something is wrong so it can become a good excuse for me being lazy, although my family has noticed it too, it's so confusing, forgive me for writing it all in a messy order. I feel like a failure in my own eyes, knowing that I could do it and yet I still couldn't hurts so so much.
P.S.- it's embarassing to say it but I don't wanna hide this, my consumption of pornographic content had increase quite a lot than before during a timespan of 2 months in between, although it's much less now, could that be playing a role in this? 

Why is this happening? Am I just overthinking and making it a big deal than it actually is? Or is it a problem? It would be great if I can get some guidance over this, or any of you guys have gone through it and would like to share please do so..

1j4kr5k,1741227013.0,does it get easier after a toxic relationship (TW),"In November 2023 I started dating a guy. He was everything I could want in a partner- so thoughtful, understanding and romantic, absolutely gorgeous and a doctor. But the first time we hooked up, he spat in my face without asking. I just ignored it, because he was such a sweet person. There were a couple more incidents where I felt really scared by things he introduced to the bedroom without asking me, often when I was in positions where I physically couldn't pull away or stop him. One time he choked me so hard I thought I was going to die. But he was so lovely I chalked this all up to my own inability to communicate what I wanted, and when I eventually suggested to him that maybe I didn't enjoy these things, he was so apologetic and never did them again. He said he felt so stupid for it, and that he just assumed they were things I enjoyed because I liked other things. 

He asked me to be exclusive quite early on, and I was hesitant because of how soon it was, but I really liked him so agreed. But after this, some evenings he wouldn't reply to me, and his friends mentioned dinner dates that were NOT with me. I questioned him about this, and he suggested it was my trauma from previous relationships making me anxious. 

Eventually I found out that he had been seeing someone else for about a month after asking me for exclusivity (he ended things after that) and that he had not been using protection. I have severe health anxiety, so this started a spiral that I am still recovering from around 8 months later. I wish I had just left it there, but I loved him so much by this point. He told me it was his biggest regret. He said he had felt insecure and wanted validation through sex, but that she meant nothing to him, that he loved me, and that he had lied and gaslit me purely because he didn't want to lose me. He paid for 12 therapy sessions for me, started going to therapy himself, and was there when I was on the phone to him for hours, just venting to him about how much he had hurt me. We tried to give things another go because I honestly believed he had changed. He spoke candidly about his feelings, listened to how he upset me, and never lost his temper even when I went on these paranoid sprees asking him who he was seeing and where he was going. 

Eventually though, I decided to end things. Not (at that time) because I thought he was a bad person, but because I hated how paranoid I had become through a lack of trust. I have NEVER minded partners having female friends, but suddenly I found myself asking grossly invasive questions about every girl he ever mentioned, and making disgusting comments about the way his ex partners looked. It was not who I wanted to be. 

It's been around 6 months since I ended things and some days I am crushed by the fear that I have made a huge mistake and lost an amazing man who made a few huge mistakes at the beginning, but learnt from them. Seeing him move on and be happy with someone else is agonizing. Other times I'm hit with another fear- that all along the cheating and the non-consensual sex acts came from a place of him liking to demean others or push their boundaries. Between these two states of mind I feel like I can't move on. I've tried everything but this is all I can think about every day- it's so agonising.

hi ! i’m (f23) and i struggle with really bad intrusive thoughts. 

for the past 4 years, i have been stuck at home afraid of leaving the safety and comfort of my room. i unfortunately still rely on my parents because of how severe my mental health is. the intrusive thoughts i have are unpleasant and violent in nature. even though i know they’re intrusive, i still get scared to leave my room or go out in public because im afraid they will happen. i can’t even look my own family in the eye or be around them without fear of my intrusive thoughts coming true. 

because of the severity of my intrusive thoughts, i am afraid of being on my own. the thought of being alone and out in public with my horrific intrusive thoughts scare me. i know they’re just intrusive but my anxiety makes me afraid that they’ll happen. i get panicked and my hands feel numb and tingly, almost as if i have a ‘intrusive urge’ to do the intrusive thought. kind of like a compulsion to do the act itself. because of this, i avoid going anyway if necessary. 

i want to be able to support myself and have a job, go get out of the house without being afraid of myself, but i have no idea where to start. since i do not have my own money nor a car, therapy and medication isn’t accessible right now. does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this? i want to be able to live life without being afraid.

I need help…(trigger warning mentioning of r@pe,v1olence,@nimal @buse , @ddiction)

I don’t normally post on here , but my thoughts are becoming worse by the day and I don’t know how to stop it. I can’t say every single detail on here as it’ll get removed but I’ll try to add in as much as possible.

I have been experiencing extremely v1olent thoughts, as in what I want to do to people and how I want to do it, (when I say this I’m specifically talking about k11ing) this isn’t really intrusive ethier , it’s something I genuinely want to happen to these people in the moment and sometimes I want it to happen even after I’ve finnished being angry. I’ve never acted on them as such, I’ve @bused animals in the past as in $tr@nglling,hitting , and throwing.

 I have also been experiencing paranoia - seeing tall,dark shadows,faces , and last night I saw this weird doll thing in my room, all of which weren’t really there. I also constantly feel the presence of d3mons and I feel like they’re watching me and want to take my s0ul etc. the paranoia is the part that worries me the most.

Another thing I want to mention is that my brother recently has had drug induced physcosis , he started to have delusions and paranoia and he believed my dad had $a him and me when we were younger and also drogged him, he is now in a physc ward to recover. When he said this I actually  wasn’t surprised because my whole life I’ve had suspicions on my dad, I don’t even feel comfortable in the same room as him,to walk near him,to wear certain things near him,or if i see him looking at me it scares me. Basically I feel extremely uncomfortable and almost disgusted and repulsed and this has gotten 100x worse since my brothers left, to the point where I even tell my dad the violent thoughts out loud. (Telling him to 🗡️ his thr00at) that just kinda comes out my mouth because I’m so angry, it’s just such an intense anger I don’t even know how to describe it. I have always been aggressive and angry according to my parents , I’ve also suffered narc abuse and witnessed @ddiction and more in my life, serious trauma basically.

To add I also just have a strong hatred and repulse to men in general, I hate them all and have v10lent thoughts towards all of them for some reason.

Some other things I do is watch disturbing content which I find pleasurable to watch - I can’t say this in the way I actually mean cos it will get removed but hopefully people know what I’m talking about? (G00re and animal stuff again.)

Furthermore , I don’t feel any empathy or remorse for these techniques so I don’t stop to think about “how will this affect this person?” I don’t understand that at all. The only emotion I’ve felt these past 6 months or even a year is pure anger and paranoia . Although I can feel slight emotion it never lasts long and I don’t feel it as deeply as other people might. I would also like to add I’m diagnosed with adhd.

I have tried to go to the doctors and cahms and they simply do not care, they don’t really do anything to help and honestly it makes me feel even more angry, if anyone has any advice please let me know because the paranoia is really getting to me, I don’t know what’s real and what’s not.",1,0,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j4fws7/need_support_advice/,need helptrigger warning mentioning rpevolencenimal buse ddiction dont normally post thoughts becoming worse day dont know stop cant say every single detail itll get removed ill try add much possible experiencing extremely volent thoughts want people want say im specifically talking king isnt really intrusive ethier something genuinely want happen people moment sometimes want happen even ive finnished angry ive never acted ive bused animals past trngllinghitting throwing also experiencing paranoia seeing talldark shadowsfaces last night saw weird doll thing room werent really also constantly feel presence dmons feel like theyre watching want take sul etc paranoia part worries another thing want mention brother recently drug induced physcosis started delusions paranoia believed dad younger also drogged physc ward recover said actually wasnt surprised whole life ive suspicions dad dont even feel comfortable room himto walk near himto wear certain things near himor see looking scares basically feel extremely uncomfortable almost disgusted repulsed gotten x worse since brothers left point even tell dad violent thoughts loud telling thrat kinda comes mouth im angry intense anger dont even know describe always aggressive angry according parents ive also suffered narc abuse witnessed ddiction life serious trauma basically add also strong hatred repulse men general hate vlent thoughts towards reason things watch disturbing content find pleasurable watch cant say way actually mean cos get removed hopefully people know im talking gre animal stuff furthermore dont feel empathy remorse techniques dont stop think affect person dont understand emotion ive felt past months even year pure anger paranoia although feel slight emotion never lasts long dont feel deeply people might would also like add im diagnosed adhd tried go doctors cahms simply care dont really anything help honestly makes feel even angry anyone advice please let know paranoia really getting dont know whats real whats

It’s a lot and I don’t really know where to start but I have to reach out to someone because I don’t know how I can help, and I don’t want to lose my mom. My mother thinks she is a target individual who is experiencing voice to skull issues. I’m not very educated on this kind of thing but I believe and hope that it isn’t something as extreme as that and that she is experiencing schizophrenia. I have told her that I believe that it is schizophrenia, and she doesn’t believe it . I guess I will start telling you about this from the beginning because I need any answers I can get.  She has told me that she heard voices on video records I would listen to the recording and not be able to hear anything. It has progressively gotten worse . Years ago my little brother's father was sexually abusing my brother and there is much evidence of this that is easy to see. There is forensic evidence and my brother has said multiple times that he was sexually abused. My mom left the abuser and went to the police and didn’t get any kind of help. The case was mishandled and closed . Now years later after the incident they are in a custody battle. He is trying to get rights and the judge has already come to a temporary agreement that he will be able to see him on the weekends. I can only imagine how much this has affected my mom and my brother . Not very long ago my mother was dating a man who was physically and mentally abusive to her (we will call him Chad) . She has recently cut things off with Chad , but I don’t know how long that will last . The reason I have given all this backstory is because these two men are the voices she hears , as well as a woman who she believes has something to do with both of them. She has never met this woman; she's only heard her voice . Now that I’ve given you part of the backstory I can say how this is affecting her now . Not very long ago she called me in the middle of the night and said she heard glass breaking like a window breaking . I rushed over because Chad is crazy and unpredictable. I got here and there was no glass broken and no one in the house . So I stayed the night to try to make her feel more safe . About a week later I got another call from her in the middle of the night saying she believed that Chad was in the attic with some woman . She heard the voices through an app that magnifies sounds. She expressed to me that they wanted to hurt her . I came as fast as I could to make her feel better. I looked in the attic and there was nothing there and I expressed to her that I wanted her to seek professional help. She told me that she thinks that these people are fucking with her and she only hears it through some sort of technology , so she said that she is going to step back from the electronics and if she started to hear anything with out any sort of electronic device involved that she would seek help. Here we are now and she does hear voices without any sort of electronics. She also believes that my brother has some sort of v2s thing going on too . He may whisper underneath his breath some and say crazy things like “the monsters come out at night” and he asked my mother “what is someone was putting rocks in my brain and you tried to stop them by putting your head in front of mine and you started bleeding “ all of these things are definitely alarming but my brother is autistic and has a horror fascination. I don’t know what to do. I am the only one she has told about all of this and it is a lot and I don’t know how I can help but she has told me she thinks about ending it . She cries so many times a day. She said they have the power to make her get sick or to go to the bathroom. They control her completely. They also make commentary about her life and what she does. For example, she was washing her clothes and the woman she hears said your clothes are ugly. They laugh at her and make her second guess anything and everything. She is thinking about being with Chad again; she says they will brainwash her into being with him again. He is an abusive man and it is not a good idea for them to be together but she says what if I don’t have any control over it . This morning she woke up and said to me that as she was waking up they showed her images and white letters . I’m not sure what the images were or what the letters were spelling, but I do know I need my mom around she is such a big part of my life and I can’t imagine my life without her so thank you for reading this far and please if you have any advice or information that will benefit us please let me know .

1j4e3ed,1741209062.0,Disassociation or spacing out?,"
I'm very confused about if I'm spacing out or if I'm actually dissasociating sometimes. I'm not sure if the cause is a lack of sleep or to do with having a vitamin D defiency or anything. I have really a terrible memory and it doesn't happen too often so I'll describe my experiences as best I can

Sometimes I'll go super lightheaded for like a second kind of like feeling I'm falling for a split second but staying on the ground- basically what I'd imagine your soul leaving your body to feel like (That's the best way I can describe it). Then sometimes my brain will feel kind of fuzzy but I can still talk and stuff just something doesn't feel quite right (This lasts either a few seconds or minuets so not very long, it also usually happens basically out of nowhere too). I tried describing it to my parents and they said it was probably just a lack of sleep or staying inside all day which make sense but I'm not sure if I trust their answers about mental health questions or anything like this because they seem to switch between 'you're just a teenager' and 'it's mental health' quite a lot which doesn't help with my confusion at all. I really want to know if whatever I'm dealing with is genuinely mental health or just regular teenage issues. (Sorry that went a little off-topic)

Just hoping that someone who experiences similar things or actual dissociation could answer this 😭",1,1,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j4e3ed/disassociation_or_spacing_out/,im confused im spacing im actually dissasociating sometimes im sure cause lack sleep vitamin defiency anything really terrible memory doesnt happen often ill describe experiences best sometimes ill go super lightheaded like second kind like feeling im falling split second staying ground basically id imagine soul leaving body feel like thats best way describe sometimes brain feel kind fuzzy still talk stuff something doesnt feel quite right lasts either seconds minuets long also usually happens basically nowhere tried describing parents said probably lack sleep staying inside day make sense im sure trust answers mental health questions anything like seem switch youre teenager mental health quite lot doesnt help confusion really want know whatever im dealing genuinely mental health regular teenage issues sorry went little offtopic hoping someone experiences similar things actual dissociation could answer
1j4anu5,1741200789.0,psych hospital?,"i’m 16F and have been depressed and anxious since i was 14. however, for months it’s been more severe. i have basically every symptom of depression to the worst extent and it’s affecting me daily. i’ve SH and have problems with eating. i feel really good sometimes and get shit done and am energetic but other times i have no energy to do anything and feel completely empty.

for additional info: i’ve been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and have been taking medication for it since birth

i’ve also been having suicidal ideation, nearly every day. no intent though, but just thinking about a clear way i could end my life and how my family would react afterwards. i low-key fantasize about it a lot. (just an fyi, i don’t do any psychotherapy or any kind of mental health care.)

i’m having a physical in two weeks, should i finally answer truthfully on the mental health questionnaire about my depression and suicidal thoughts?

i would also like being prescribed antidepressants or being referred to psychotherapy. however, i think in CA, a parent has to consent to psychotropic drugs and a minor cannot. im pretty sure my mom or dad will consent. i am anxious though that my parents won’t actually follow through and take me to a therapist even with the referral.

again, i’m not that worried they’ll do anything serious about the depression. but they will probably take me to the ER (and afterwards possibly a psych hospital) for my suicidal thoughts. i would like for this to happen. however, my parents will flip out and will probably get so mad at me.

any advice? my parents are really spiritual, so they don’t believe in mental health care. i’m scared to be honest to my GP in front of my mom. (shes the one that’s gonna go with me to the appointment). i’m also not worried about insurance too much because i’m covered by Medi-Cal.

1j3veuk,1741150671.0,"19, Depressed and struggling with finding motivation and disappointing parents.","I am a nineteen year old male and have been living with depression and anxiety since I was 14. For the past year and so since graduating I have been struggling immensely with motivating myself to do anything. I am currently in therapy one day every two weeks, I find it helps, yet I have suicidal thoughts every day. 

My parents pressure me to find a job often, and rightfully so, I only work one day a week  and I would like to find a part-time job, but I find it so incredibly difficult to make myself do anything. I also worry things will get worse if I feel even somewhat as mentally exhausted as I do after one day of work. I currently won’t even do or try to accomplish things I enjoy anymore. I’ve expressed my desire to achieve something with my life but also my feeling that my life is hopeless and fated to end with suicide or failure. I feel as though I’m just laying idle because I’m afraid of death and want to be as close to it as I can without actually committing suicide.

I want to die but to also succeed and my parents get frustrated with that contradiction and say I don’t actually want to die, which could be true but I’ve thought and planned out death before.

I would also like to go to University for English Literature, but every time I start the application process I get overwhelmed, anxious and nihilistic at attempting to figure out the process. We are currently attempting to look for an ADHD diagnosis since we’ve expected I’ve had it since I was young. I also  messed up a lot in High School and now have to upgrade a course for university and it’s gotten much more stressful and overwhelming to me for that. Not to mention even more damaging to my already weak self-image.

I feel so incredibly overwhelmed by life right now and like I’m a complete failure for my lack of a proper job, a pursuit in my interests, or going to university.
I feel like life is not capable of getting better and it’s my fault for not motivating myself to do anything. Suicide is prominent on my mind and it frightens me that it feels like the easiest option for me.

1j3z3fg,1741165992.0,Can I be my own support network?,"Hi guys I never usually have the mental energy to write this but have wanted to for a long time and I have it now so using it while I got it ha. Bit of rough context because this is too long to get into fully. I’m 24yr old female, family has history of genetic mental illness from my dad’s side and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder from a young age (which my dad also has). At 17 I was also diagnosed with autism which was a developmental set back to say the least having to relearn myself, caused a lot of confusion on top of the struggles I already faced. Anyway I’m sure I don’t need to get into the ins and outs of what I go through on a daily basis for my life as I’m sure most on this sub already know. I’m now medicated on a medication that really helps - me and my dad are on the same thing and I’m much better than I was but of course - there’s no cure for what I have and that’s okay I’m learning as I go to manage things. Point is im a lot better now, I’ve struggled in life too financially I’ve been SA twice once quite as child and once in adult life, been homeless been pushed into a stage of prostitution in order to pay rent all of these I’m not proud of but we are dealt the cards we are dealt and my past does not define my future. 

Anyways context over - I met a guy, we got together my life has drastically improved and changed. I’ve always lived away from family since 16 and although the relationship is better now I’m used to living away and I prefer it this way. I moved up north (England) to live with him. I’m isolated from family (again nothing changed) and friends (although I already lived away from them and never been good at making new friends) so nothing changed from the isolation really. We are a year and a bit in and we’ve bought our first home which is insane, I have a stable home for myself and my 2 cats. We got a dog who I adore and I’ve always wanted. I have a lot really and I’m so greatful for the opportunity and stability he’s brought into my life. My family adore him (which is a first completely and very strange for me) he loves my family, I like his and care for his too. 
It’s an ideal situation on paper. But I’m currently fighting for dear fucking life.

I love him and I don’t want to lose him, when we are good we are great but the reality is I’m not good all the time. This is the first relationship I’ve ever been in where I’ve felt alone and unloved. It’s really altered myself. I’ve been in relationships constantly which isn’t good but it’s understandable when I analyse my behaviour based on past experiences. I crave that close connection, love and protection and well friendship that I’ve never truly experienced. It’s a deep need that if I have to fix - I’m not sure I want to yet. I’ve been known as very tough and cold on the exterior as I put up a barrier I suppose for protection. I’ve always been in fight mode so relationships for me was this chance to let my guard down and just breathe and feel safe. You could say I’ve been with people sort of similar to myself the ‘bad boy’ type exterior but so kind and soft with me although they would publicly show it. And I adored it. I should also mention I’ve left everyone except one in my relationships and broke them. I suppose I run away or feel like I need more which I know isn’t healthy. I wasn’t going to get into another relationship until I found “the one” as in the one who was right for me and the one to share my life with. I thought I’d met him. And I’m unsure now. The issue with us which I’ve seen is I still feel like I’m in fight mode and I don’t have the support around me to give me what he doesn’t. If I’m low or sad deeply hurt he doesn’t do what I need to support me. There’s a lack of empathy there completely and if I bring it up he says “that’s just me”. I’ve done so much growth mentally and spiritually and I can recognise when his ego is in the way instead of acting out of love and care. He’s had a rough childhood and dealt with it through blocking emotions out but when we first got together I saw so much that “wasn’t him”. He was kind, attentive a good listener, he looked in love. He still is all those things but only if I’m ‘happy’ and if I talk about something that’s bothering me or if I struggle as I did last night with suicidal thoughts he goes blank.

Last night for example a build up of emotions came up I felt overwhelmed and stressed about a lot in life and not following my path I wanted to in my career and I broke down completely. I couldn’t see a way out, he had a good day and I spoke to him about it he didn’t know what to say he hugged me. But I needed to talk not to be touched. I called my mum because I needed help and was scared, I bawled my heart out on the phone while both mum and dad tried to talk to me and showed concern and care. He just made spag bowl next to me like he didn’t care at all. He brought me some food after which was nice but I needed help and needed him to talk to me but instead we watched tv my eyes still swollen and chest aching and ignored it. Because I needed him there and I didn’t want to ruin it.

I went to the kitchen and started cleaning up still holding my pain in, I was cleaning because I had a lot to do in the morning and I can’t do it with mess. He came in and spoke to me with arrogance about something and snarked at me. I just flipped chucked the kitchen roll at the wall I had in my hand and burst into floods of tears telling him not to talk to me like that when I’m on the edge of hope. Where is your kindness. 

I walked away got in the shower bawled my heart out and tried to slice down my arms with razors. I haven’t done that since I was 16. It broke me that I was led to this, I couldn’t get far because I couldn’t get the razor blade out the case, I covered up and stepped outside and he was on the sofa on his phone. I proceeded to cry in bed then went numb and stone cold. He eventually got into bed and said nothing with me holding in tears again and hyperventilating. I couldn’t sit there while he listened to me cry it was humiliating, so I went in the living room to sleep and cry. He eventually came in and asked what I’m doing, we spoke which basically consisted of him saying my reaction pissed him off and he needed space and telling me to come to bed. I tried to explain that it hurts you feel pissed at me for reacting to the way you spoke to me when you’ve heard and felt my pain this whole evening.

Anyway long story short convo went stagnant he made me get into bed cuddled me kissed me and went to sleep. Side note: had a dream that I was in a toilet cubicle taking a shit and I could see someone’s feet behind the door, they broke in and pulled me away with my pants down and we had a fight lol. I’m guessing this means I felt extremely vulnerable and exposed from last night. That or I needed a shit.

So here we are this morning and he acts completely normal, kisses me and goes to work while I stay working from home (when I should t) and blag a migraine. 

I don’t know where to go what to do I can’t leave him even if I wanted to, I have nowhere to go and no money so I suppose what I’m asking is how do I give myself a support network internally, is there a way? I have no support no friends to message either and I can’t afford therapy now nor think I can go through the process of unpacking everything again and again until I find someone helpful. I want to focus on myself and do exercise essentially have a glow up physically and financially. How can I mentally support myself?

1j3qx49,1741136548.0,Need some advice. CW SH,"CW: mention of S.H

Sorry to the mods if you remove this. I understand :)

I am 19.
I don’t have any diagnosed conditions and I am not seeking one. This is more of a vent than asking for help.

When I was 15, I didn’t have friends, not real ones, I was in the process of coming out as transgender, and in the middle of lockdown. I was, as you can imagine, very hormonal, very angsty and sad. I wasn’t bullied, just very insecure and unhappy. I decided that S H was the way to go. I wasn’t suicidal, I didn’t want to die, I just didn’t want to be sad anymore. I did this for around a year. In 30c weather (heatwave in the UK), I would be wearing black hoodies and black jeans. I struggled but made it through, playing it off that it was because I was trans and didn’t want to see my chest so much, which was very true but not the reason.
Eventually, I stopped. I waited for my scars to heal before I told my parents what I had been doing and they were very understanding.

It had been 4 years since I’d done so.

Had.

I don’t mean to sound like I’m bragging or proud of that because I’m really disappointed in myself. 4 years. I was okay for 4 years. I coped for 4 years. And now it’s all gone. Can I just not count this instance? It was a one time slip up.

I don’t understand why I did it. I’m not depressed, just having a hard time. I am having a bad time at work, finding the motivation to actually do what I’m supposed to when I’m there. I get to work fine, and I’m happy but I just can’t actually do what I need to do, I just stand around waiting for things to just happen themselves I guess. People at work re starting to hate me because I’m lazy. They constantly whisper like I’m not even there. I’m searching for a new job but I just keep getting rejection emails, even with 2 years experience. The other day, I handed my notice in to my boss, gave myself a month to find new work. He called me into the office to talk, and I just cried. I wasn’t going to cry, I was going to be angry and yell about all the problems at work, like I said in my letter. But, my boss. He is an excellent man, he just told me to think bout it, listened to what I could actually say and told me he would be checking up on me. Asked if there was anything else going on that’s not work related. I told him that it’s just everything, I couldn’t think/say anything specific. I mean, I have had 6 months of 3pm-10pm shifts. And there is no end in site. I haven’t had more than a week off all together since November, which doesn’t sound like that long but before that, I’d saved my holiday hours from the entire year for 4 weeks off paid. I had surgery abroad and needed recovery time. I didn’t want to come back but I needed money because even now, I still owe £2500 for my surgery. 
I think part of why I am so unhappy at work isn’t excactly because of work. I come home and it’s not much better. Our house is now more mould and damp than actual house. My bedroom currently has a leak in the roof, which has now allowed for fucking mushrooms to grow up there. Mushrooms. And I can’t afford to do anything about it. I’ve tried clearing out the mould as much as possible, I’ve tried wiping down every surface, I have a dehumidifier going 24/7 but nothing helps. I’ve given up on it. I gave up a while ago actually. I don’t bother cleaning up because even if I do, it looks horrible still. The other day, I had to throw things in my own way, so I’d be motivated to clean up. Even then I only cleaned up the stuff on the floor. 
I haven’t showered in 3 days, haven’t brushed my teeth in over a week. And I just fucked up after 4 years.


I should go to a doctor, seek out a diagnosis, but part of me is saying that medically, there is nothing wrong with me, that I’m just being lazy, and I’m happy a lot of the time, so I can’t have anything wrong with me. But most of the time, I’m only really happy when I’m around other people. Most of the time I don’t really feel anything. I don’t really feel sad, just… a bit like this 🫤 not sad, not happy. Just…I exist.

My little sibling has DID, and I love every single part of them. Recently, something happened and the original alter/host split about 32 times. The others were able to piece them back together but right after that they split in two again. My sibling has the kind of DID where all of the alters come from the original alter, and they all really rely on them. Every time they’ve split, it’s never actually gotten rid of an alter before, but this time it did. One of the alters recently tried to kill themself because the system couldn’t function without their original. I know which alters are from the original, and neither of them like fronting much nor do they have much of an identity, and we know it’s possible to merge alters back into one but… we don’t know how. I want to help them so much because all of the alters are slowly starting to lose themselves, and we’re scared that eventually everyone is going to keep splitting to try and escape. 

Does anyone know how we can get the two new alters to merge back? Or at least some way to get the old one back?

1j392bx,1741089178.0,"I have an online friend who’s really struggling, and I’m not sure what more I can do","
I have an online friend who’s going through a really hard time — with their parents, with life, with everything. They tell me they’re going to therapy and that it’s helping, but at the same time, they often text me really dark and heavy things. It’s not new for me, and I always try my best to respond with support and reassurance, but sometimes it feels like nothing I say actually helps.

I’ve told them that the only way forward is to push for change — to step outside their comfort zone, even when it’s hard — because staying in the same place, just complaining about how unfair life is, won’t make anything better. But I know that’s easier said than done.

What makes this more complicated is that this is an online friendship. People have told me before that I might never meet them, and that all I can do is offer words — whether they take my advice or not is up to them. Still, I can’t shake the guilt I feel when I can’t seem to help them.

I’m starting to realize that while I care about them and want to support them, it’s not my responsibility to fix their life. I want to be there for them, but it’s overwhelming at times — especially when I’ve been in their shoes before.

So, I’m wondering — how do I set boundaries without feeling like I’m abandoning them? How can I remind myself that their healing isn’t solely on me?

1j37mzv,1741083284.0,Any support / clarity on my situation would be appreciated,"Hello, I’m new to this type of thing (reddit, SA and support groups). I’m a 24 year old man and came to the realisation talking to my cousin about childhood trauma yesterday that I may have been SA’d as a child but I’m not exactly sure. 

Basically what happened is, last year while watching the menendez brothers series, Erik (I think) spoke about how his brother abused him but made it out to be “a game” so he thought it was normal. While watching that it triggered a memory of my own involving myself and my childhood neighbour who was older than me. 

I would have been 7-8 at the time, my neighbour being 12-16 (I don’t remember exactly). Over at his house playing Star Wars, I was a captured Jedi. He was playing the role of the enemy and to determine whether I was Jedi or sith he needed to inspect my genitalia for a “marking”. He proceed to touch and look, I felt very weird about it but when along with the “game”. 

Another time, we were playing at his house our play ended up in his bathroom. I can’t remember exactly how or what led to this but he wanted to play a game where we would touch eachother. We each took our pants off and he proceeded to touch and jiggle my butt while I faced the other way, he wanted me to do the same, I wasn’t so keen on doing so. After his mother walked in asking what we were doing, I don’t remember much other than feeling like I was in trouble or had done something wrong.

Both of these moments happened not long after the other, I can also remember somewhere before or after the 1st time, he introduced me to porn.

Nearly 20 years later I feel confused about the situation, a little in denial whether it was SA or not and angry about the situation almost as if my innocence was stolen. 

Any support or clarity on this situation would be greatly appreciated. I’m new to this whole thing so any help would be great.

1j31lta,1741059156.0,Struggling to find purpose / reason,"I am 22F. I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy after struggling with debilitating sleep issues that worsened over the last year. I just started a new med (modafinil) on the 1st for that. I was also \*diagnosed\* with endometriosis in December (did not receive surgery, but met with surgeon to discuss options where she told me she was 100% certain that I had stage 4 bowel endometriosis. I am not able to get the surgery any time soon).I

I've struggled with mental health issues since I was 12 (bipolar 2 and ADHD). I am usually medicated, but had to get off of all of my meds to get the narcolepsy diagnosed. I had to stay off of the medicine in order to take the new medicine for the narcolepsy. 

I am struggling with life right now. Last year, (before both narcolepsy and endometriosis diagnoses) I had a pretty solid plan for my future. I was loving college (sophomore), super excited to pursue my career. I figured out what exactly I want to pursue and where I want to pursue it (marine biology at CSUMB in California), and I was genuinely hopeful and excited for my future. I knew I had health issues, but they were kinda easier to pretend I didn't have because there was no specific diagnosis set in stone. 

 I am pretty poor, but I had just enough in savings to justify moving to the college in California to study (was gonna take out a few loans too). I then got in a minor car accident that cost me about $2000 of my savings, and had other expenses that had to come out of savings vs income. I am full time in school, and I was working two jobs to make ends meet and save money for this future I had planned. I had to quit my one job because it was too physically demanding and I couldn't do it anymore. I now have pretty much 0 hope of ever being able to afford to move to my dream school, and I cannot pursue marine science in the Midwest where I currently live. 

I had also started talking to a guy who I genuinely thought could end up being The One (cheesy, sorry) and it didn't work out due to our busy schedules and just general miscommunication. I told him on my end I was willing to reconnect if he got less busy, but he didn't seem all too interested. I am left feeling even more lonely than before, as I got so hopeful that things would work well because they had been going amazingly the whole time up until the abrupt end. 

Due to the recent health diagnoses, I have struggled in school to the point where I have probably skipped at least 1/3 to 1/2 of all of my classes since January 14th. I am not learning or retaining information, I cant focus, I am too tired from the narcolepsy to even get out of bed to go to class. I am considering doing a medical withdrawal because I just cannot function. 

I am now at one of the lowest points in my life. I lost a lot of my savings, I had to quit a job, I found and lost a potential partner, I don't have a solid support system. (My mom died when I was 15, my dad is abusive and absent, rest of my family doesn't speak to me. I have friends but I feel like I am always a second option or just someone they will talk to/spend time with ONLY if they have no one else. ) I feel like I cannot pursue my dream career, so college feels pointless. I am in pain every day from the endometriosis, but I cannot get surgery because I have no support system or way to pay for my life when taking off work for said surgery. Plus, my case is complex in the sense of they cannot guarantee me that surgery would help at all. I am constantly exhausted too, and I have barely gotten enough sleep since January 10th when I started weaning off my meds to begin the narcolepsy diagnostic journey. 

I know being off of my mental health meds is seriously screwing me up and making me catastrophize. But I genuinely sit here and feel like my life has fallen apart. The only thing that keeps me going is that I have a dog and a cat who need me to care for them. I just genuinely have nothing super positive to hold onto, nothing fun or exciting to hold onto. I am just surviving, and I am so sad all the time. 

I am not sure what I am trying to gain from this, but I just feel so painfully alone. I feel like I could disappear and nobody would be affected. I just wish there was a solution to any of my problems but I cannot figure anything out. I am so young and I am so hopeless, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I am just so tired. I wish I had someone in my life who would be there with me through this, who could go to DR appointments and hold me when I am falling apart. I don't have anyone for that. I try to talk to people about this stuff but I can tell it overwhelms them, so I have been trying not to talk about it as much. I have never had a support system though, so I have not really processed much of the issues in my life. 

It just feels like no matter how hard I try, things keep getting worse. I don't know what other steps to take beyond the ones I am currently taking. I guess this is a rant, because I don't know what anyone else could offer me in terms of solutions. Life is hard. 

**What I am doing to try and help myself:** treating narcolepsy with modafinil, but the side effects so far are brutal. treating endometriosis with pelvic floor therapy, general pain meds, supplements, but it doesn't help much. I have a therapist for general issues, and a new therapist for relationship issues (the situation with the guy really messed me up more than it should, and made me seek treatment for my previous traumatic experiences). I am going to try to get on a new mood stabilizer for my bipolar, and I am hoping the modafinil helps the ADHD due to it being a stimulant. I am trying to focus on my hobbies and start new ones. I have also bought some books and am trying to start journaling again.

1j33xxt,1741066998.0,I don’t know how to help my sister.,"I’m 27 and my sister is 25. We’ve been extremely close our entire lives and because of a complicated childhood I’ve often taken a more maternal role to her and our other siblings.

Last week my sister attempted to take her life. She was admitted to inpatient treatment for what was supposed to be a 72 hour hold. She called me today crying and panicking because they told her she could either rescind her 201 and agree to stay longer or there would be a hearing tomorrow morning to have her committed. I told her I would speak to her nurse and find out more about what’s going on.

Well I spoke with the nurse. She hasn’t participated in her care since she got there. She’s refusing to attend group, doesn’t engage in therapy, isn’t eating or taking medication, and won’t make a plan for after discharge. She doesn’t have insurance so she can request a lateral transfer to another facility but it’s very unlikely it would be approved. After speaking with the nurse I called my sister back and tried to explain her options. She was furious that I couldn’t get her discharged. In our 10 minute conversation, she threatened to take her life 3 times before hanging up on me and then letting her team know they’re no longer allowed to discuss her care with me.

I found out shortly after that while speaking with her husband, she told him if she couldn’t leave inpatient tonight she would kill herself. I fought with myself for a while before making the very hard decision to call the hospital and let them know what she’s said and that she may be looking for a way to harm herself.
I know my sister. She’s likely giving them the silent treatment hoping this will go away, which means the hearing will happen tomorrow morning, where she’ll find out I told them what she said, and that I agree she needs to be held for further treatment.

I’m sick. I’m terrified she’s going to find a way to hurt herself. The thought of her lying in that bed thinking she’s being held against her will for no reason is breaking my heart. I can’t even watch tv to try to distract myself or sleep because everything seems to remind me of comforts she can’t have right now. I just want to hug her so badly right now and make her understand she’s sick. That I’m in an impossible position to do what I have to in order to try to help her. 

I’m scared she’s going to hate me the rest of her life, and that it could end up being for nothing if she continues to refuse treatment to get better. I just need someone to tell me I’m doing the right thing.",1,2,/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1j33xxt/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_sister/,im sister weve extremely close entire lives complicated childhood ive often taken maternal role siblings last week sister attempted take life admitted inpatient treatment supposed hour hold called today crying panicking told could either rescind agree stay longer would hearing tomorrow morning committed told would speak nurse find whats going well spoke nurse hasnt participated care since got shes refusing attend group doesnt engage therapy isnt eating taking medication wont make plan discharge doesnt insurance request lateral transfer another facility unlikely would approved speaking nurse called sister back tried explain options furious couldnt get discharged minute conversation threatened take life times hanging letting team know theyre longer allowed discuss care found shortly speaking husband told couldnt leave inpatient tonight would kill fought making hard decision call hospital let know shes said may looking way harm know sister shes likely giving silent treatment hoping go away means hearing happen tomorrow morning shell find told said agree needs held treatment im sick im terrified shes going find way hurt thought lying bed thinking shes held reason breaking heart cant even watch tv try distract sleep everything seems remind comforts cant right want hug badly right make understand shes sick im impossible position order try help im scared shes going hate rest life could end nothing continues refuse treatment get better need someone tell im right thing

I've fully relapsed into depression again. Been having suicidal thoughts everyday recently. I feel like I can't get what I want out of life, and I'm so tired of being told I should be happy. Like fuck off. It only makes sense to be upset about situations that suck. I feel like I'm going to be an outcast and single forever. Not enough money to do more than survive. Everyday anxiety waiting for everything to fall apart.

1j31hf6,1741058785.0,So worried about my brother (m27) and his recent break from reality,"FOR CONTEXT: I'm a full time college student. I really, really don't want to deal with my family's issues. I'm trying to grow up and live my own life. But the current circumstances are stealing all my peace, making me constantly tense and worried. Not only that, I have my own mental health shit going on; I've been so depressed lately.

I posted this on another sub, I'm trying to get as much advice as possible. So here's the lowdown:

He's 27m, lives in rural Arizona with his roommate and his roommate's mom. Has ADHD and Level 1 autism (previously known as Asperger's). Did ketamine for a while. Is always changing his ADHD meds, it seems. Has had a problem with weed in the past, don't know how much he still uses it.

So I can't tell his whole life story right now, but growing up was very rough for him and our family was rather dysfunctional. He blamed religion for the dysfunction. Every time I talked to him on the phone he would complain about our parents' religion and how it ruined his life and how God doesn't exist, that sort of thing.

All that suddenly changed in literally two hours. One evening he was having one of his usually family phone calls, complaining about religion. Then he called back and suddenly believed in God again. Out of nowhere. And suddenly he's all like ""my parents are my saviors."" Very weird.

All week, he's been calling and texting our parents to ramble on and on about religion and God. My parents have been praying for YEARS for him to stop being an atheist and come back to God, so of course, they were delighted. I was the only one who had a sinking feeling about the whole situation. It was too sudden.

Sure enough, yesterday he had a full-blown psychotic break and his roommate's mom had to call an ambulance. He ran away from the ambulance into the desert. Was having paranoia and delusions and being unsure whether he was in heaven or hell. He's back from the hospital but it seems like nothing has changed. He's saying some really disturbing things, like a schizophrenic person would say. Like he doesn't know where he is or what's going on.

But my parents? They don't seem all that concerned. They're still trying to ""evangelize"" him. They insist that God is using his mental health episode to bring him back from atheism.

I'm just really scared for him because I don't know what happened. It's like he transformed into a completely different person.

Since I have religious parents, of course they're just focusing on the ""he's now religious!"" part instead of the psychosis part. Trying to convince them that this isn't normal or OK for him is like talking to the wall. It almost seems like they're taking advantage of this.

Being far away from him is hard. It doesn't help that his roommate's mom, who's been keeping us updated, is ill with Parkinson's and can't really be a caregiver. I don't know what to do.

Got any thoughts about what might be going on? I feel kind of like I'm screaming into the void here.

Tl;dr: My formerly atheist brother turned religious in the blink of an eye and started having complete personality changes and psychotic episodes. My parents are just glad he's finally being religious again.
