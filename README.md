# Crisis-Related Social Media Analysis Test

## Overview
This test is designed to evaluate candidates' ability to:

✅ Extract, process, and analyze crisis-related discussions from social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.
✅ Apply sentiment analysis and NLP techniques to assess high-risk content.
✅ Geocode and visualize crisis-related trends on a basic interactive map.

## Tasks

### 1. **Data Extraction & Preprocessing**
- Use APIs (Twitter API, Reddit API) to collect relevant posts using predefined keywords.
- Filter posts based on engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments).
- Store extracted data in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
- Clean and preprocess the text for NLP analysis (remove stopwords, special characters, and emojis).

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis & Risk Assessment**
- Implement sentiment analysis using models like VADER, BERT, or RoBERTa.
- Classify posts into risk levels: **Low, Moderate, High Risk**.
- Detect crisis-related phrases indicating mental health distress.

### 3. **Geolocation & Data Visualization**
- Geocode social media posts (if location metadata is available).
- Use libraries like Folium or Plotly to create an interactive crisis map.
- Visualize crisis trends based on geographical distribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `praw`, `tweepy`, or relevant API libraries for social media data extraction
- `nltk`, `transformers`, `scikit-learn` for NLP and sentiment analysis
- `pandas`, `geopy`, `folium` for data processing and visualization

## Expected Deliverables
- A Python script for data extraction and processing.
- A cleaned dataset with sentiment scores and risk labels.
- A basic interactive map visualizing crisis-related trends.
- A short report summarizing key insights.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy of Data Extraction & Cleaning**
- **Effectiveness of Sentiment Analysis & Risk Categorization**
- **Quality of Data Visualization & Insights Provided**
